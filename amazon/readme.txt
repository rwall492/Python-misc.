This script is aimed at performing basic sentiment analysis on reviews for various books from Amazon.com.
The most basic script (supervised_count_vec_analysis.py) examines four pre-defined categories defined by certain key words and how well each book fits into those categories.
A more advanced script using Tfidf is still under construction.
