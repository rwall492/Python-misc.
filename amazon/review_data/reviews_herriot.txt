"This is not the type of read that you can't put down.  Not a page turner. That is one of the reasons I liked it.  I could read it leisurely for enjoyment and put it down without feeling like I was missing out.  I love animals and the people who love them and think anyone who does would like this book.  Full of interesting accounts Of animal care and treatment, interesting animal characters and their interesting often comical owners and situations."
Classic! Had to start all over again with the series that I read years ago.
It is so pleasant to read a positive book full of life and love!  You will enjoy it for sure.
Loved it!
Used for a homeschool lit class
"I love these books and have for years!  James Herriot can describe things so well that you actually feel as if you are there with him.  I've laughed and I've cried reading these books and they will never, ever get old.  The characters are so interesting and the way he can describe the scenery, I'd dearly love to visit the places he's been to.  If you love animals, you'll love these books.  Even if you don't love animals, these books are a joy to read!"
"Beautiful stories, excellent delivery and book condition. 5 stars"
Great James Herriot book!  Well done.
I love the story. James Herrot takes us on a wounderful journey into the life of a vet and the people who make up his life.
"As a girl raised on a farm in the Midwest during the late l950's, I find this book very interesting."
These books make you feel peaceful in a hectic world.
"Great book. If you love animals and are in any animal profession, you'll love this!"
"One of the best books ever written.  If you like Dr. Pol or Rocky Mountain Vet, etc. you will love James Herriott. Funny, interesting and touching."
"This book is a great read.  Full of humor in the day to day work of a country vet in England in the 1930's.  It's light reading with short chapters that you can read whenever you have a few minutes, standing in line or waiting for a car wash or whatever."
"This book is a wonderful escape to simpler times when people really enjoyed and appreciated each other. James Herriot is a master at conveying the things that truly matter. A great read, especially for animal lovers."
Fun book!
"This is such a heartwarming book, and so funny in parts. Dog lovers will appreciate reading this, it's a famous book."
great book
"This book was a lot of fun to read. The writing is excellent and gave a wonderful picture of real events in another time and place. Thoroughly enjoyable, light read. Short chapters make for a fun experience during those in-between moments when a heavier read is too much to dive into. I will definitely seek out the rest of this series and will probably explore the old TV series as well."
"I bought this as a gift for someone, I'd read all books already and still could't put it down. I hope he likes it as much as I did!"
"the original all creatures great and small was better. However this one was very enjoyable. Nice to read a good book that is not depressing, and degrading as so many are today. A good dessert book!"
Every animal lover should read this and learn.
Has always been my favorite. I read it over and over!
"As I did 40 years ago, today my granddaughter loves this wonderful collection of animal & people stories."
"I love James Herriot's writing style and also his tenacity as he looks after the creatures great and small in the little Yorkshire town of Darrowby.  His character sketches are hilarious but never cruel and within the humour, you can see how much love and caring he has for animals. While he puts a humorous gloss on life - and the breathtaking scenery and delicious food are beautifully depicted and easy to envy - it's clear that life is tough in the 1930s.  Even disregarding the war looming in the background, a simple car journey is hazardous without windscreen wipers and negotiating a rough winding road punctuated by vicious wire bound gates.  And nobody could envy the three am cow midwifery!My only criticism of the omnibus version is that some stories are missing, so the story arc of James and Helens' courtship is fairly rushed compared to the single book versions. It is worth starting with the single volumes and if you like the style, keep collecting them!"
Loved this book!
Loved this book. It is quietly hilarious and beautifully well spoken. I cannot wait to read the rest of the series.
"Interesting, but long winded at times"
This is the fourth time I've read this book. I enjoy it just as much as the first time.
One of the best books I have read in a long time. I didn't want it to end. This book was masterfully written and completely held my interest throughout. It was almost a fantasy to me.
This book is charming! Mr.  Herriott (not his real name) gives a wonderful account of what it was like to be a veterinarian in the 30's in England.
Just what I needed.
"If you like animals and want to read about kind, gentle, and amusing people who are unassuming and tolerant of other's idiosyncrasies this is a book to read.  It takes place before the war (which is to come later) and tells about farm life and the veterinarians that serve the farmers.  People know their neighbors and village life is pictured as both satisfying and sometimes difficult, but the people do what has to be done to get by.  The writing is both clear and edifying.  It's a bygone life style that's depicted."
So enjoyable!  Can't wait to read more.
Herriot is an all-time GREAT!! Wonderful stories!
"My wife is a daughter of a Yorkshire farmer and James Herriot's words brilliantly capture for us the culture of the era, the humor and the struggle for existence.  We are longtime residents of Texas, but the author's words make our former life seem like yesterday."
"""Feel Good"" reading at its best!  Reading this again after 30 years is like getting together with old and dear friends."
"In my opinion, this is one of the greatest books of all time. I have sat down and read and reread this book dozens of times. It is very well written and warms your heart. Any animals lover, veterinarian, rescue worker, or shelter attendant should read."
These stories are always delightful.  Have enjoyed them for years.
It was a great read. Funny and interesting.
Made me laugh
Excellent stories
I seldom re read a book and I had read this years ago. But I was so glad to find it again. thoroughly enjoyed as much as the first time. I felt I was meeting an old friend-Dr. Herriot.
"This book is thoroughly enjoyable. Hard to overstate how well it is written.  I feel like I know well each character described, each place visited.  Mr. Herriot writes very candidly about the difficulties of the life he chose but it is obvious he absolutely loved his job and the people he worked for and with.  Intelligently written, insightful, warm.  To me - about perfect. Will no doubt be rereading it this winter - good stuff with warm fire and good single malt."
Funny and poignant and educational and completely absorbing.
I got this as a gift for my husband who is in his last year of veterinary school and he loved it :)
Great fun! I laugh often while reading this book.
It is just a classic. It is good CLEAN reading for every age.
Very interesting book - I would recommend to all animal lovers and just about anyone who likes to read books.
Great book!  It came in excellent condition!
"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I could envision standing exactly where he stood and seeing exactly what he saw.  I felt the bitter cold when he did.  His descriptions were so precise.  Yes, I loved it and have purchased paperbacks of the other books he has written."
Great author with realism and creativity in developing the narrative .
My first James Herriot book!!!  Great read.
Excellent.
One of my favorites books of all life - I can't tell you how many times I have read it! Sweet and poignant and real.
"Herriot's series of a country vet in rural (1930's) England are a must read for all animal lovers everywhere. While a little dated, they are  funny and poignant. I have fond memories of my mom reading these books and laughing out loud. The books are:ALL THINGS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL,ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALLALL THINGS WISE AND WONDERFUL, THE LORD GOD MADE THEM ALL."
Just started it....so far loving it!!! (from pg.1)
The authors first book is a joyful and very humerous glimpse into rural England of the 1930s and his start as a vet. Treating pets and farm animals....dealing with the crusty locals...James Herriot recounts his life with such skill. His relationsips with the vet who hires him and Siegfried's  brother Tristan are described with warmth and humor. Everyone needs to read this book.....you will laugh and cry at the same time!
"A modern-day classic. Wonderful tales of the life of a young veterinary surgeon, set in the Yorkshire Dales. Unforgettable characters, both human and animal, will captivate and engage most, if not all, readers. Full of warmth and humour, this book is a delight to read. Five stars."
"If you love animals, and find yourself always mystically and wonderfully enchanted by the interactions between human animals and non-human creatures, you will savor this book.  Simultaneously, one can learn some veterinary methods from the past.  I wish I had become a veterinarian!"
It's an amazing book.  An excellent read for anyone.  I could not put it down.
Great.. anyone who loves animals is good to read about.
Love how the author paints the picture of his practice and the community of farmers. I read this as a teenager...enjoyed it then and now.
beautiful book -reading aloud with my 12yr old.
great book
Read all of James Herriot books.  Written by a vet.  What more can be said.  He knows his animals and knows how to tell stories.
print way toooo small!!
Great book. Very funny and entertaining. The author is a good writer and knows how to keep your attention. Can't wait to read his additional books.
Rereading this. It is just as good now as it was when it first came out.
I just love James Herriot and can read these over and over.
This is a must read for animal lovers everywhere! It will have you in stitches laughing out loud! You will be endeared to this country vet whose writing style is like  breath of fresh air. Love it.
"I didn't know a book about animals could be well-written. This is an interesting book and to my surprise, I enjoyed it very much."
One more terrific book in Herriot's series of books about life in the early 1900s in rural England.  Great descriptions ofcolorful characters both two-legged and four-legged.  Enjoyable reading.
good read
love it
This is such a wonderful book.  It is a classic.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves animals and the people who care for them.  It is a heartwarming story that gives you an understanding of how hard it is to be a vet.
Thoroughly enjoyed it.
"Wonderful book! I read them many years ago, and I enjoyed getting reacquainted with my old firend James Herriot. Great read!!"
I love all the books written by James Herriot!
I grew up on a farm and can remember the dedication of the local vet. This  book brought back memories and helped me appreciate more fully the importance of all God's creatures and their purpose in the grand scheme of things and life.
I love this book. Herriot paints beautiful pictures with words of the people and places in his beloved Yorkshire.
I have reread this several times.  Great book for all ages!!
"I love this book. It shows true love and compassion for our animal friends and for two-legged creatures as well. There are a some antiquated words, but with a Kindle, it's super easy to get the definition. I intend to read the sequels too. The few TV episodes I watched followed the story lines quite well."
"Oh I love James Herriot's books. They are funny and all about people in the village and the area. Of course, also about the animals he treats in England."
"This is a great book, especially if you have ever been a vet or in the medical field or have nostalgia for that small town life!."
Excellent!!
"Enjoyed reading the book, as it gave a slant to life from standpoint of a veterinarian.  The book seemed to present a historical perspective of life around animals in a farm environment in years past."
"Well written chronicles of a old country Vet.  Some of the language was a bit odd, as I don't live in that part of the world, but enjoyed it very much."
Funny and a nice glimpse into the past.
I enjoyed the books and the reading of this audio books is true to the books in every way.
Unbelievably well written book and even though it was written long ago the humor is still classic
Three and a half stars.It was well written.Very descriptive.
"I've read all of the James Harriott books and loved the PBS series. I wanted this on my Kindle.  They are interesting and funny, suitable for any age group. I worked as a vet tech for 7 years and saw just how much veterinary medicine has come."
One of the best.
"I can't really add anything that hasn't already been said, I loved the book and wanted to leave it a five star rating."
Good stories
"Classic reading, especially if you love pre-war England."
Excellent reading
Great books.  I bought all three at the same time and couldn't put them down till I had 'consumed' them all!
"This book, and its followups, were best sellers years ago when I read them and they still are great reads.Ask me why and I would have to pause and think about it and I'd come up with same answer I did back then--because they are enjoyable stories written by a man I think I would have liked to have known. They are real. They are human. They are about someone who cares, not only for animals but people and nature. He is someone you can relate to. If you've ever had a pet, or lived on a farm, or had a friend that you liked just because, or if you ever loved from afar and especially if you won that love. The stories include funny ones, sad ones, glad ones whatever type you can think of that make up a persons life--it's here.I could say so much more but let me end with this. My College Literature teacher told me, after I read my first Classic and I enjoyed it, that these books that are still read after decades and even centuries are still popular for one reason---They are great books!The works of James Herriot belong in this category and that is why I read them again after decades and decades of time.Enjoy them, please."
Everyone should read these books.  Got this for a young lady who LOVES animals...
I love this series of books
"Wow what is there to say , James Herriot my favorite yorkshire vet,  Plus i am from the very area  this was filmed ,, this whole seriesis a must read ,, Its a shame that he is no longer with us,,"
The beautifully written stories had me laughting out loud throught the whole book. Herriot describes his surroundng and life in superb detail with exquiste imagety. His vocabulary is also  astounding yet very easy to read.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the three other books in this series! I highly recommend it to anyone!
I've been reading these tales for 30 years.  They never get old and always leave one in a pleasant mood with a smile on one's face.  The author has an uncanny ability to describe characters and events with a delightful and memorable voice.
I read these years ago when they first came out and I'm rereading them now.  They have stood the test of time.  Wonderful stores about a bygone era and a different way of life.  James Herriot is in a class by himself.
one of my favorite series
It doesn't get any better than James Herriot.  Wonderful books that are interesting and easy reading.
I have read James Herriot book several times and it never gets old.  It's a keeper because it gives me the joy of a good laugh and also the interesting life of the 1930's when my folks were raising teenagers and I was not born yet.
For the animal lover in all of us.
If you like animal stories this is one you must read.  There is a lot of life and activities to learn in regard to care of farm animals and the history about their care.  It's informative and interesting but not boring.  Enjoyed a lot of the personal touches in the story.
SUCH A CLASSIC!!!
This is a wonderful book - he is a magical story teller and knowing he is telling us real life stories makes it all the better.I highly recommend this series of books - it helps me escape today's frantic life style.
Refreshingly simple and feel good read.
A classic series
This book never gets old! I've read it at least 15 times!
the best book for teens! I loved it when I was 9-10-11-39!
Everyone should read this delight!  A classic from the start.  You will not be able to put it down .  A good choice for teenage readers as well.
The format was a disappoint.
Thanks
"The three main characters were hilarious. I loved reading this book before bedtime because it put a smile on my face before I went to sleep. The descriptions of the countryside, the people, the animals are wonderful."
Wonderful book for all!
A wonderful book. I had read this many years ago and gave my copy to my twin Granddaughters to read. I purchased this copy for a young man who I mentored in our church who loves animals.
Our family loves the books from James Herriot.  Very humorous stories.  Good for bedtime stories.
"With gentle humor and a sure love of the people and their animals, Mr. Herriot delights us with the first book in his series on the life of a Yorkshire vet.  Such a lovely book!"
"Very uplifting, positive book!  I would recommend this book to any and every one!  His descriptions put you right into the story!  I feel as if I know (and love) each character.  I have just started 'Bright and Beautiful.'"
"If you love animals and a great story teller, you must, must read these books by James Herriot. He will have you laughing out loud with one of this experiences and then tears will come to you eyes with the next. He makes you feel as if you are there with him and he truly appreciates the beauty of nature. I wish I could have met this very special man. This is a must read as well as a wonderful gift for anyone, any age, who love animals. Can't say enough, you just have to experience it."
"This is the classic book by James Herriot about his experiences as a veterinarian in the early part of the 20th Century in England.  The stories are wonderful, and I have read the book several times.  It would be a suitable book to read to children.  Anyone who loves animals would enjoy this book.  I purchased this particular book for my cousin, who is also an animal lover.  She thinks the book is great."
Another book my daughter requested and both of us have reread it at aleast twice over the years.
James Herriot is the best!  I love his humor!
Fun book.
"My wife loves Herriot's stories. Given her delight in the content of the book, ""5 Stars"" would've been the deserved rating. I've lowered that to 4 because of the binding. I bought this particular copy from Amazon based on the information that it is hard-bound. While that is technically correct, the book looks and feels like a mass-market paperback, right down to the sort of cover you'd expect on that type of book – except that the covers are hard.To be sure, the price was low, so I don't feel cheated. But I do feel misled. This was a birthday present, so I was looking for, well, ""a real book!"" Is it possible that I missed some perfectly clear text in Amazon's description? Of course. So I may be making, er, much ado about nothing.If you like the Yorkshireman's veterinary tales, and you like a compact book with heavier-than-usual coverstock, this might be just the ticket for you."
read this book years ago and it is still a great read
We wanted a standred size hard copy.  We got a very small copy.  Could kardley read it.
"This series is what I pick up to read if I am 'blue' and need a 'pick me up'. It is well-written, entirely enjoyable, a great opportunity to peer into 1920s-1960s life in England. The series includes pre-antibiotic veterinary care, WWII, a love story, and much more. The exploits of Mr. Herriot (as he was called) and his colleagues, and antics of the animals he treated result in memorable stories worth re-visiting from time to time."
Wonderful story
A classic.  Great writing
"great customer service, item as described"
"This is an incredibly delightful set of books.  I first read the whole set when I went through a very difficult time in my life that went on for months.  I feel these books saved my sanity.  They are so well written, written with love and how can you not de-stress when you are reading about a country vet taking care of animals.  He is wonderful, he brings humor and love into the stories.  I absolutely loved this book and all the rest in the series.  Good for calming the nerves, they are uplifting, loving, caring, sweet, funny, entertaining...wonderful!"
Exactly as expected.
"What can you say, this is a great classic that I haven't read since maybe the late 70's?  Very funny.  After I re read it to make sure it's appropriate for my 9 year old ( I always get surprised by the things in the content I don't remember from back when I first read a bood decades ago)  I'll probably order the rest in the series to read with my daughter.Great stuff that is just the life of a country English vet way back in the day."
good read
"A very good and pleasant book to read.  It seems to present a valid description of rural life around York before WWII, as well as describing the life of rural veterinarians.  This is a second reading for me."
I love this book and plan to keep it on my bedside table to read over and over. I laughed out loud in some parts and teared up in others. I would recommend this book to anyone who can read .
Herriot's endearing style never fails to bring a smile to my face. No many how many times I've read the book.
"Let me clarify that the content, stories and writing is wonderful. I love James Herriott's writing and anecdotes.  The low rating for this particular item is due to the poor choice of paper, binding and cover.  I purchased what I thought to be a hardcover book for my niece's birthday gift and was sorely disappointed.  The ""hardcover"" is cardboard with paper pasted graphics.  The pages inside are an off-color, very thin, recycled newsprint type paper.  The print is small and the pages were bound so closely to the inside edge that it was difficult to read the beginning of each line.  I promptly returned the item and found something entirely different for my niece's gift."
wonderful book written so anyone can see life in England in the 40 's - great humor!  - a book for everyone!
"Beautifully written book of a country veterinarian as he was just starting out after graduation.  Very, very well written."
"This is a great book for anyone who loves animals, and a good decent story. I read all of the first three books in this series of stories, many years ago, when they first came out. Once I start one of James Herriot's books it is so difficult to put it down. The stories take place in a simpler time in the history of our world. Mr. Herriot has a positive attitude toward the world around him, and a very loving heart toward people, and nature. His personality, that of his boss, and his boss's brother, make for an interesting story,and a variety of views on almost everything. I will be going on to the next book in this series, in a short time. Then, will continue on with the rest of the books. Hopefully everyone who decides to read these books will enjoy them as much as I do."
This book in the world!
i have been charmed and delighted by this simple work of simpler times and ways. i found it fun and readable and have been transported to that time and place often when i am fed up with the modern world.
"I wanted to replace my old paperback of this classic, five-star book with a hardbound edition, and ordered this from Amazon. I guess I should have been wary of the $14 price, because when it showed up, it was the size of a small paperback book, with the cheap paper and printing that mar so many of today's paperbound books. And the cover is like a ""fake"" hardbound -- sort of a laminated plastic. Turns out the real hardbound version is out of print, but it looks like maybe they are about ready to reissue a real hardbound edition, so check the listings periodically if you want a new hardbound copy."
I have read this book several times through out my life and each time I read it I feel as if I'm reading it for the first time.  The stories are so heartwarming and the people so real.  I end up smiling at the end of each chapter.
"I read this book many years ago, and really enjoyed it again. It brought so much pleasure, and for a few minutes to set aside all these unpleasant daily news and violent events.If you want to relax and enjoy the daily challenges of a country veterinarian, read this wonderful written book."
I love animals and this is a good book.  I also like to learn about veterinarians.  James Herriot writes in a style that taks you with him.
"If you love animals and country settings, this book is for you.  I will not spoil the plot for you."
I read these books years ago. They are worth reading over and over again. You will cry at times and laugh out loud. Just delightful.
"This book began a little slow, but as I read on it ""grew"" on me. At times I would find myself smiling or even laughing at some of James's adventures. There were not alot of  ""small"" creatures, but plenty of ""great"" creatures. There was one small dog that brought much joy to my heart as his owner would shower James with gifts!! I loved the closeness I would feel with the country side and with the day to day life of a caring vet. I am now moving on to book two. Thanks"
Re reading this delightful book since I first read it about 30 years ago. So glad to get reacquainted with James Harriot.
"A wonderful adventure filled with love for the farm land and animals of all kind. Please read and enjoy. Though it does get slow so and so,  every few chapter is filled with great excitement."
Really good. Easy and fun to read.
"If you haven't read this book, you really should.  It's a book I often give as a gift to friends in need of a good laugh.  It's been around for years and it remains as hysterically funny now as it did when I first read it back in the '80's.  Need a laugh?  Read it!"
Great book! Very pleasing read!!!
I have loved James Herriot books since they were first published. I had worn out several paperback copies so now I am ordering through the kindle app. From my beloved Amazon.
Wonderful!!  Reading it for the second te
James Herriot  was my favorite author of all time.  The whole series is well written and make me want to live in the area where the book was supposed to have taken place.
"I bought this book for my GREAT Granddaughters who enjoy reading.  I loved these Herriot books when I was young and absolutely give it a 2 thumbs up for your children, grandchildren, GREAT grandchildren to instill the love of reading into them!"
"Having visited Scotland several times in my life, I can relate to the story and the characters within, even in this day and age.  We have four Scottish Border Collies, and the stories in this book resonate strongly with the love we feel for our dogs. I did not put the book down for more than a meal before I finished it.  Even now, it makes my heart long for the UK country-side."
"I have just finished reading this book for the second time - the first reading was from a book my mother gave me for my birthday years ago; the second was from my Kindle just a few weeks ago.  This is an amazingly wonderful story told by a country vet in Yorkshire.  Humorous, touching,heart-warming, this story will capture you and keep you entertained all the way through.  And when you are finished with this one, there are three more books in the series:  All Things Bright and Beautiful, All Things Wise and Wonderful, and The Lord God Made Them All.  If you love animals, this is ""must"" reading, and even if you are impartial to the critters, the story is full of human nature experiences that will amuse and captivate you and make you want to read more and more.  I highly recommend it to everyone who loves a good story."
Worthy of 5 starts
"It is so well written and so entertaining. I highly recommend it. Not only do you get deep insight into the life of a vet, but the quirky lifestyle of English country living."
Fantastic series.  This version was for DVD version for Region 2 (Europe) and will not play on our Region 1 machines.  There are machines available now that play all regions.  The cost of the series and a new player  was less than the price of the Region 1 version of the series.  Now I can watch for great recordings of programs produced anywhere in the world.  This was a great learning experience.  I enjoyed this series on its first run and like it better  now.  I shall look forward to finding treasures produced other than in the US.
thank you very much....it arrived in excellent time and in terrific condition... I can always count on you to do a good job!
"It was the TV show that introduced me to James Herriot. I have many wonderful memories of watching it as a child. But his writing as just as brilliant as that production was. The way he paints the characters in the mind of the reader is brilliant, and there are so many engaging and varied characters to feature! Highly recommended."
Excellent audio book. The material by the author is wonderfully funny and poignant and honest. The person who is narrating the book is perfect for the part. It's one of the best audiobooks that I've listened to in a long time...and I've already listened to it twice!
"Very well written, funny, endearing look at a man's life as a large animal vet.  Extremely interesting stories about hill folk and their stock.  I liked the anatomical stories, too."
I read this series many years ago and loved it.  Bought again so I could re-read at my leisure.  Wonderful stories.
"James Wight was a born writer!  His writing style allows the reader to immediately put themselves into the setting.  I first read this series of books almost forty years ago. I'm starting over and am about halfway through All Creatures Great And Small.  I loved this book the first time I read it and probably even more so now. The reader MUST have a love of animals and a grand appreciation of the beauty of our wondrous planet. I have only seen Yorkshire, England through the eyes of James 'Herriot' Wight."
"Well written. Descriptive enough to allow you to get a mental picture of the people and places but not overly done. It was an enjoyable easy read that kept my attention and was never dry.  Very well done, a must read."
"I really enjoyed re-reading this story after many years.  It is a warm story, easy to read with short and entertaining chapters."
Easy to read an enjoyable life of a veterinarian and his everyday life in the 30 s .  A book everyone should read.
"This is my 2nd or 3rd time reading this timeless book.  I plan to read his others again as well.  Herriot writes of life in rural England and his experiences as a new veterinarian. His prose is plain, his stories short, and his heart as big as the largest animals he helped.  This is well worth reading and saving as I did."
Just a great book.  Read a hundred books and you may not find one this good. A first person report from a large animal vet. In 1930s England
Herriot is exquisite. I've enjoyed his writing for years...one of the few people I read over and over again an laugh with every time.
I read this book many years ago and all the other's also. This man is so special. His love for his job and the animals he treated is so obvious. This is a must read for children & grown ups. If you love animals you will love all his books.
"Another great book by James Herriot.  No matter what your age, you will find his books interesting, humorous, educational, and good clean reading.  I have recommended them to my friends who are Big Brothers/Big Sisters.  The reading material is great and the books can be discussed after each one reads them."
"My mom gave me this book when I was a young girl and told me to read it. I did . . .  and dreamed of becoming a vet. I'm not a vet now, but this is a great book about animals and the rural life. Herriott deftly manages humor, suspense, and the cliffhanger. His love of animals and the people of the Yorkshire community he practiced in come shining through in this great book."
I owned all of James Herriot's books and loved everyone of them when I was a young man. I look forward to renewing that wonderful experience of entering James Herriot's world of a rural veterinarian once again.
loved this simple but powerful story. I would recommend reading all of his stories. this is a great read. I'm going to review the BBC series now.
This book is about the rural Yorkshire veterinary practice of James Wight. It is set in the late 1930's right after he graduates from vet school. It is well written and the author has a great sense of humor. I enjoyed it when it first came out in the 1970's and enjoyed reading it again. I also purchased the sequel All Things Bright and Beautiful after reading this.
"Arrived on time and as promised!  Am enjoying reading it again!  Would recommend it to anyone who loves animals and good people stories without sex , bad language, and violence!"
If you've missed the t.v. series this book will certainly make you want to look it up. I DID watch the t.v. show religiously and loved it. I was surprised to learn how closely the series followed the book. I'm only sorry there'll be no shows ever again. The book is worth every penny you spend to buy it.
"All Creatures Great and Small is a wonderful story set in Yorkshire.  The writing of James Herriot is beautifully sentimental.  Another great book of his is Dog Stories, a book of short stories that make you laugh and cry.  Excellent book and excellent writer.  All Creatures Great and Small is also available in DVD's, there was a movie made and then a BBC TV series starring Christopher Timothy and Robert Hardy."
"Interesting and well written.  I learned a lot about large animal issues and how they are treated.  I give anyone credit who decides to go into animal veterinary-it is often a very tough job, but, obviously rewarding!"
"Herriot has a great talent of setting a scene, establishing characters and discerning place in a matter of a few sentences.  The true character of the story is the community which Herriot serves with love and insight that often humorous, poignant and earthy.  At times the story gets a tad bogged down in vet visits but collectively they pay off In a novel you won't forget."
This was listed as hardcover but it was just a cheap paperback with cheap yellow pages and a laminated cover.
"I loved it the first time and yes I had to read it again, loved it because it was many years ago I read it and so now it was like reading it for the first time"
This book never took off for me.  It was a bit boring and never seemed to change.  I loved the characters but they never got interesting.  sorry.....
Such a wonderful book! Very  good stories about the life of James Herriot. Highly recommend this book to everyone young or old or inbetween!
"James Herriot was a writer who captured me right from the beginning of his books. All show a simple life and well lived. I cannot put any of his books down, I am just thrilled with his stories."
So happy this is now in Kindle format!  One of the best writers of all time. Everything he wrote was stellar!
Short chapters. Each a story unto it's self. Takes you back to old England. You visit so many great characters.
My god daughter has talked about wanting to be a farm vet.  She is not much of a reader but i hope for her she gives these stories a try.
"Just a great book. Well written, stories are from the heart, and prose is engaging and stimulating. Perfect, especially if you love animals and/or medicine."
"The story is engaging from the first page, full of humor and life, an insight into a profession and snapshot in time."
"Good packaging and super speedy delivery, as usual! James Herriot tells his earthy tales with a rare wit and makes fun of himself. He's one of my favorite authors and I love everything he writes. Don't pass him up!"
I recently bought these books again after having read them many years ago.  Still loved them...  But I had forgotten how much swearing they contain!  That's the only caveat.
"Loved this book, chose it because I was told it was about our veterinarians great grandfather, or uncle, from back home.  Let my mother in law borrow it and she enjoyed it so much that she bought the whole set.  For animal lovers of all kinds, this book is funny, emotional, and just a great read."
"Not much to say about this warm and charming book, 500 pages, because it was exactly the PBS series, which I saw before I read the book.  Starts with his bus ride, and ends with Helen sitting on a stone wall, writing down TB testing.  The writer for the TV series just lifted whole and entire from this book,  Very little got left out, which is good, because the book is enchanting and rather uplifting, in a gentle way.  Highly recommended."
"If you love books about animals and the people who spend their life caring for them, then you'll love this book.  It's an enjoyable read!"
"Absolutely enchanting! I will always treasure these stories of loving God's creatures. :) thank you for the privilege of experiencing a world of goodness, commitment, & integrity."
"I finally decided to take my mom's advice--many years ago when I was in my teens or twenties, my mom, an English war bride, mentioned that Herriot's books made for pleasant reading. Never what I'd call a true animal lover, I pooh-poohed the idea. Now at age 66, a year after my mom's death, I decided to try All Creatures Great and Small and then see if Herriot's writing was appealing to me. Well, you guessed it; now I wish that I could call my mom and tell her that Herriot kept me interested all the way through despite his descriptions of nature which don't particularly excite me. I now want to go on and read his other books.At first I was a bit let down because after the book begins with the story of him and one of the farm animals in his care, making for very exciting reading, the second chapter gives us some background information and description. I'd been thinking that it would be just one exciting animal story after another. I had to slow down and tell myself that I'd have to be patient--that Herriot wants to tell the whole story--of him, of his boss and his assistant, of the farmers who own the animals, of the English countryside in all its splendor, of the vehicles he is forced to contend with, and the weather he must confront. It's a big story and it's partially autobiographical and partly fictionalized.I came to realize that the descriptions of the people and the countryside help to give the reader some respite between medical encounters with the animals in his care. Your breathing can slow down a bit until the next animal story stimulates your heart and nerves. I will say that the people stories may amuse you. Some of these people, including the hero's boss, are very eccentric to say the least. But I still feel that the animals provide the heart-pounding excitement in the story.I've never been what I'd call an animal lover or a nature lover. In recent years I've been reading many memoirs. So this is a memoir, although somewhat fictionalized, and it contains just enough excitement, beauty, and heart to keep many readers engaged throughout. I've already started reading All Things Bright and Beautiful and just want to say that his recollections bring back memories of my own marriage in the early years. I was moved to tears by the final chapter of All Things Great and Small. Fascinating reading. But I'll say one thing--I could never be a veterinarian!"
I LOVE this book that's why I ordered another OLD soft cover; the older versions have a much better cover. I received a LARGE hard cover this time so I put it in my apartments's library so the other tenants could enjoy it.
Hell of a good book! Love stories about animals. Excellent production. Readers accent makes the story more real and he does a wonderful job on the different characters in the story.
"I read these books at least annually - so upset when he passed away.  Books are funny, sad, and a real feel for the area they are set in and the life of a country veterinarian."
"I read all the James Herriot books as child and was ordering the first in series to introduce my kids to these wonderful stories.What is sold as a hardback is **NOT** a hardback. Is a small paperback with a flimsy, thin cardboard cover. Even the paperback aspect was cheap quality as the pages are see-through and less weight than a standard paperback. The pages have no outer margins, i.e., the text runs right to the edge of the paper.  Almost $20 for a cheap paperback. Cover and front pages have no publisher/copyright/printing info - bootleg??Bought under Amazon Prime so assumed would be receiving the usual quality and ""fit to description""."
Wonderful book.  One that makes you happy as you read.  Once again proves America's love for all things  British.  I love a book that makes me laugh.
I love this book. This book is best which I had ewer read. The book have very original idea. And fabulas humor...
I like his writing and stories; he is a very entertaining writer and tells stories very well.  I would recommend it.
"I just finished rereading James Herriot's ""All Creatures Great and Small"" for the fifth time. His books are wonderfully written and give great pleasure no matter how many times they are reread.  His books are in my permanent collection so I can pleasure myself a s often as needed.  Give yourself great pleasure by reading all of his books."
"A heart warming accounting of the everyday life of a young country Veterinarian in Scotland/England.  They don't just treat puppies, kittens, etc......  How about horses, cows, goats and the likes.  Very interesting."
I provided this book to a young student who wanted to be a veterinarian after high school. It was a book used to help inspire her to follow her dreams.
I read this book years ago when I was a teen. I read it again 25  years later and its better than I remembered.
Beautifully written. I share Herriot' s love for the untamed countryside of Yorkshire. His imagery brought me back to this beautiful place.
"A fabulous collection of characters and tales that you won't be be able to part with, even after the final page."
"You just can't beat Herriot's stories, and I've read them all--several times--to my kids, friends--everybody who'll listen. Great for animal lovers or those who just like stories!"
"If you like James Herriot, you will like this book.  I liked his cat stories better.  This one was a little too long winded"
Purchased as a gift as his real last name is the same as mine.  It made a good present for my mother.
Too much money for a paperback bound in a hard cover. This product should not be described and sold as  a hardcover book.
"This book is full of interesting stories,fascinating plot twists, and lovable characters. Great for everyone, from ages 1 to100. Fantastic!"
"Love this timeless book.  A glimpse into a life in the country side with interesting characters.  Can be read, then put down for awhile and then picked up again.  Perfect summer read or read by the fireplace."
Read all the Herriot books long ago and I'm still in love with them. Probably read them again in 5 years. Great for anyone who appreciates animals and pastoral living.
"Because we enjoyed this book from the library and the television series, we ordered the book for a gift.  The book arrived with a broken binding and the book was small.  No thanks!"
"It's one of those books where I wish I had not read it, so I can enjoy the thrill of reading for the first time again!"
"Highly recommended to all animal lovers in your lift.  Can't go wrong with James Herriot.  Wonderful, warm story line! Great."
"A collection of wonderful four-legged (and a few with two) friend stories strung together by a Scottish vet's great prose and endearing persona. Anyone who has loved any animal, will connect with this book. It has tears of joy and sadness, humor, love and painted imagery and sounds of the 1930s English country-side. In a word - pathos. Another- emotive. Despite its simplicity - be ready for a few laugh-out-loud moments ( I refuse to say LOL), like cleaning a window with a chicken, quite a few sentences that have to be re-read, to understand the thick written brogue and keep a tissue or two handy. Be sure to collect a few phrases to add to your everyday vernacular.http://oddsandhens.wordpress.com/2013/05/04/reach-read-all-creatures-great-and-small/"
I LOVED IT WHEN I FRIST READ IT A LONG AGO AND I STILL LOVE IT TODAY HILARIOUS AND GREAT. A MUST READ AND TREASURE BOOK FROM THE LATE AND BEST ENGLISH STOR ELLERS EVER TO LIVE JAMES  HERRIOT GET IT READ IT YOU WILL LOVE EERY WORD OF IT.
"A document of a profession in the past written with humor, fun to read, a great companion for difficult times.L. Stigol"
I love the Herriot's series about his vet days on the Yorkshire downs.  They never fail to make me laugh and laugh!
"This is a great book. Author writes with great wit and compassionm for his subjects, both animal and human. Can't wait to read the rest of the series."
"Extremely well-written, compassionate narration of the life and dedication of a veterinarian, practicing his profession in the beautiful Dales in northern England."
I had loaned this book to a friend out of my set and never got it back. I ordered this specific book to replace the one in my set and it was exactly like the one I had before. I couldn't be happier.
"One of the best books ever.  It is witty, charming, sad and happy.  I rank this book at the top."
I highly recommend this book for anyone.  It will be difficult to put it down once you start reading.  James Herriot's first book and when your done with it you will want to read all of his books.
"My favorite book of all time-I've read all of the James Herriot books, but this one is closest to my heart!"
"I usually don't write reviews positive or negative. I'm making an exception here because I don't know the condition of the book because it was a gift. Scheduled for delivery on Tuesday 23rd but didn't arrive until the 25th. It was a gift for Administrative Assistants Day and the person left for vacation at noon on Thursday it arrived, according to tracking, at 12:40 PM.My major complaint is that this always happens when Amazon ships a small via. FedX. This is  because they turn it over to USPS for final delivery which always delays the item at least one day. I didn't think it would happen to a book in a major city otherwise I would have ordered it earlier. I have always considered UPS & FedX about equal but if I could choose a shipper I would choose UPS then either the US Post Office or DHL over FedX. If nothing else the former three have the decency to ring the door bell when they leave a package - rain or shine. I thought it was a local issue but since the book was delivered 400 miles from me it must be business as usual for Fed Express."
"This is a warm, wonderful book.  Stories are told with humor and insight.  Read the whole series...you won't be disappointed!"
I enjoyed the discription of the countryside and life In the rolling dales of Yorkshire in the early years. The young veterinarian from Sunderland joins a new practice and his experiences of the small country farms and with stubborn  farmers set in their ways are engaging and sweet. This story is witty and heartwarming.
"The people, animals and their antics are described in a way that is captivating and very amusing. Even though it was written many years ago human nature and animal behaviour has not changed and one can easily identify with a lot of the characters, two or four legged!"
"I read these books first in high school, and am rediscovering them and enjoying them even more!  All animal lovers should read them."
"I have read James Herriot's whole series previous, but my book club wanted to read it and it is purely delightful a second time around."
Great novel in the vetinary practices of the 1930's - the 1950's. His crystal insight into the personalities of th people he came into contact incredible. Very funny and interesting. At age 60 ... I fell in love with this series while in college during the 70's. Strongly recommend the whole series.
James Herriot's natural writing ability is both captivating and endearing.  While he tells of his life beginning as a young veterinary surgeon we get caught up in both the animals he treats and thepeople he sees. Filled with humorous moments.
My spouse enjoys the descriptive way James Herriot writes. As an agriculturist he finds the stories right up his alley.
Fun to see what this guys clients get themselves into very interested in vet work especially for my 11 year old self
"Read the series many, many years ago and enjoyed the 1st book of the series it even more that the 1st time. Will read the rest of the series again as well.  The books humor must get better with age, probably my age."
"I read this book many years ago and picked it up once again to enjoy once again a life of a young man becoming a vet and what he encounters and experiences. That is not only with domesticated and farm animals but with the people who care for them. Some stories are sad like the old man who had to have his dog put down. All in all, a wonderful story."
I really enjoyed this audiobook and will probably look for more by this author. the story kept my interest besides being entertaining.
"I have read many of James Herriot books, and love every one of them. I actually purchased this book for my brother, and he can't put it down. The stories are actual, factually correct, and give real humor to rather unpleasant occcurences that are actual situations."
"Great book, it is one of those that people should read.  It gives great insight into the world of farmers and those who help take care of their animals."
"Read this and you will fall in love with the English countryside and the life of a country vet.From calfing to lambing to the author's imaginings and his own courting story, in witty style and easy prose, this book is so easy to read and fall in love with."
"A worthy read. Good price, easy download and son enjoyed reading it very much. Would recommend it to teenager or older who enjoys animals."
We purchased this as a gift for a family member who loves James Herriot books and she was very happy with it. I can remember being read these stories when I was young and reading then over and over again. He was an amazing author and vet. A wonderful gift to you or someone else.
My daughter loved animals and after she read this she was sure she wanted to be a vet.  So that is what she went to college for.
"Pages are somewhat yellowed from age.  Doesn't look very new, though cover is in very good condition.  Reprint in 2004, I believe."
"I enjoyed this book, it offers up light entertainment with a bit of a laugh. If you want to unwind & relax this will  hit the spot. If you're after action & excitement however look elsewhere. It's extremely easy to read & I would recommend it to most readers."
I am not a person that enjoys reading.  A friend suggested this book to me.  It is an easy read and right up my alley since I am an animal lover.  I would suggest it to anyone that is considering it.
Love his quaint charming country story about animals and life in the village. I highly recommend any and all of his books.
Unfortunately I bought this book twice It is a good read and they characters are portrayed well.  Good holiday reading
All Creatures is a GREAT book but this one was not suitable for the child I wanted to read it.  Thank you for allowing me to return it.  Theo Woods
This was a book that I had never read but heard lots about.  It's very good and anyone who is a animal lover and loves 'slice of life' books will enjoy it!
"This book is a delight from beginning to end.  Animal stories are not my genre of choice and the only reason I read it was because it was the selection for my book club.  The first chapter made me curious, but not overly engaged. Pressing on I discovered a delightful storyteller in Herriot.  He uses his actual experiences as a rural veterinarian in early 20th century Scotland as his source.  He mixes up the personal and incident details in order to preserve his clients' privacy without sacrificing authenticity. The end product is a book I didn't want to put down and was sorry to discover the last page."
One of the few books that you will laugh out loud....loved these when I read them about 30 years ago.....beautiful..touching...
"Since first reading James Herriot I was drawn to the richly told, heart-warming stories.  The characters he details almost seem to become real in the reading.  I have enjoyed each of the books from this series."
I only ever saw one episode of the TV series and have occasionally come across excepts from the books. This was a wonderful read and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
"All the stories are great. Some make you laugh and some cry. The only complaint, and a very very small one, is that some stories are repeated, but they are all worth reading again."
"Very disappointed this product is shown as a hardcover.  And it is, but it is a paper back put in a hardcover."
"What a wonderful book!  I read this many years ago, and Christopher Timothy is a wonderful reader.  I saw the series on PBS, and listening to it is a real treat."
how can you argue with a classic? I like that each chapter is a story in the life of the doctor.
James Herriot's self deprecating humor and warmth is unbeatable.  Even if warm fuzzy loveball creatures are not part of your life you'll love these heart warming stories.
"I've read this book before, and was delighted to read it once again. James Herriot mixes life stories with veterinary experiences to make truly enjoyable reading. Each chapter is a little story in itself, so it's also an easy book to read out loud to someone (as I did to my Dad when he was hospitalized). It's also a good book to read right before bed to wind down. If you love animals, or books about people living their lives, you'll love this book."
"James Herriot wrote these amazing books and still today, they ring true with joyous warmth, humor, and sadness. The characters are lively, funny and instantly memorable, and though I first read these books in the late 1970's, they still lift my spirits today. I highly recommend the entire series for anyone who loves animals."
I read this book many years ago and becane an instant fan of James Herriott. He had me laughing out loud at some of the antics. I have since then have read all his books. If you have never read All Creatures Great and Small do it. You will not be sorry. This is just one book I bought at Amazon.
"It was simply exactly what I hope for, I could get it quick and clean. I'm happy with the product and the shipping time."
Delightful.  Loved reading about all the experiences of the vet in his early days.characters are memorable and like the humor.
"A beautiful story, it will definitely touch the heart of anyone especially for those in the Profession of Veterinary Medicine. I recommend that any person wanting to study this career should read it; it will show the real heart of the veterinary medicine.Una bonita historia, definitivamente tocará el corazón de todos especialmente para aquellos en la profesión de medicina veterinaria. Recomiendo que las personas interesadas en estudiar la esta carrera lo lean; se mostrará el verdadero corazón de la medicina veterinaria"
"If you like animals and medicine, this is the book for you.  Thoroughly enjoyable reading about rural England where James Herriot had his veterinary practice for many years.  You'll read about difficult deliveries of young farm animals in the cold, damp air of the English countryside and the many amusing clients who frequented his practice, both the animals and their owners.  There is no foul language and there are no sordid affairs to clutter the amazing life and times of this remarkable Veterinarian.  I found it refreshing."
"Great book. I gave it so someone as a Christmas gift, and I was happy that the hard cover version is still available. I would recommend this book to anybody."
All the books by James Herriot are excellent.  The author reflects a love for life and for other people that is uplifting and encouraging.  We highly recommend all of his books. We purchased this as a gift for a newly married couple.
"I have not read the Kindel version of this book,but have read in soft cover, most of James Herriot's books & I just love them.I have sat & cried & then I have laughed out loud.They are very special wonderful books."
Very funny. I could read this book a hundred times over! It's full of great English humour! James Herriot's real-life experiances are side-splitting!
"I love James Herriot's books!  I love all things 'veterinarian'.  He makes the stories so personable, humorous, and touching.  I'm looking forward to reading all his books."
"I totally and thoroughly enjoyed this book - a great read! The experiences the vet had while serving his country, the heartache of being separated from his wife, and how he used those experiences to remind him of the people and animals he had helped.  Wonderful book!"
"I've loved this book every time I've read it, and this time was no exception. I could read it over and over. Thank goodness he wrote several more like it."
"Another great book by the wise and wonderful James Herriot. This book will make you want to read on and on, letting you forget about the things you have to do. A great buy and I recommend."
"I have heard about this book and its sequels before, but I guess I remembered it somewhere on the background of my mind. When I saw by accident that this book was on sale, I bought it. I thought it started slowly - just as life in English countryside in the 1930s must have been slow and unhurried. We meet the young veterinarian who  also narrates the story when his practice just begins and with him we get to know ""all creatures great and small"" whom he meets, helps to get better when he can or helps to end their sufferings when he can't. I thought this book was full of love in the best way and very well written."
"Mr Herriot has a very interesting if not downright unique way of telling a story from the perspective of a country veterinarian about the animals he treats. What's unique about that? Well, it's not just the particular animal he's observing, but also the far reaching interrelationships of it's people parents he's looking at through the kaleidoscope of life's pulsating dynamics."
"He respects the reader's intelligence.  He doesn't soften veterinary realism.  He never plays or acts the hero.  He is very funny.  He brings you into his village to see the good, the bad, and the absurd."
"I read this, and all of Herriots' similar books, (there are several), several years ago.  I remember them fondly.  I laughed, I cried, I savored each chapter/story; as each chapter was a story on its own, and each chapter contributed to the whole.  The first time I flew through it.  The many times I've read it since - so many times pages are now taped into place - I have slowed down and savored it.  This book is a true gem."
"This is the story of James Herriot, a country veterinarian. Actually, Herriot wrote many books about his experiences, but I think this is the first one. It had a lot of humor in it, from the hilarious (though I'm sure they weren't at the time) procedures that he goes through with different animals, to Siegfried Farnon, the quirky and odd vet who Herriot is assistant too. There were always great descriptions of the English countryside as well as the amusing people who live there. The repartee between Siegfried and his younger brother Tristan as well as between Siegfried and their secretary Miss Harbottle is really side-splitting. Herriot narrates throughout with a typical British humor, though he is fairly cheerful. He describes his various cases and what life is like in the countryside.*You can read all of my reviews at my book review blog, <...>"
"If there was one series I would recommend to my son/daughter it would be this one. The first time I read it, years ago, I instantly fell in love with James Herriot, SiegfriedFarnon and complete cast of hysterical characters, some human some animals. He has a way with descriptions that is unique. One minute you're laughing your head off, the next thing you know, youare near to tears! My favourite of all time!"
"I read this books as a kid and wanted to read them again.  Some how they made me want to be a vet, I must have glossed over all the time that Mr. Herriot spends with his arms elbow deep in the various orfices of cows, sheep and horses.  Despite this the books are delightful.  Heriot is a good author, his friends and clients are hilarious.  You will laugh out loud often, keep a special eye out for the ones that involve Tricki-Woo."
"I actually picked up this audio book on a lark, and am really thrilled that I did.  I am a regular listener of audio books and use this time travelling too and from work to enjoy.  All Creatures Great and Small was  easy to listen too with the tales of Dr Herriott you can almost picture yourself there,as he travels from one experience to the next.  The stories are detailed and vivid and so much so that  I find myself looking forward to my morning and evening drive just to hear the next few chapters.  I thought this audio book was excellent to say the least and will be picking up the next in the series."
"These stories are timeless and the reading is excellent.  Animal stories are wonderful for all ages, and James Herriot's stories are people stories too.  These are wonderful for listening to on car trips."
THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOOK IF YOU LOVE ANIMALS.  IT'S FOR ADULTS AND TO BE READ TO CHILDREN.  IT'S A BOOK TO READ AGAIN AND AGAIN.  THE SELLER IS GREAT TO DO BUSINESS WITH.
"Heartwarming and excellent in every regard. James Herriot's storytelling is incredible, and his stories are no less vibrant. Almost every person he meets has their own vibrant characteristics. From joyful and good-ending boy/dog stories and disappointing hardship tales from the dales around his practice this is a book I would recommend to young and old, cantankerous and ebullient."
"I listened to the audiobook narrated by Christopher Timothy.  It was pleasant.  It is partially autobiographical, but primarily fiction.  It was written by a veterinary surgeon who worked in Yorkshire, England, starting in the 1940s.  It is told in the first person and describes the working life of a country vet whose primary patents are large farm animals.  He is sometimes injured by the animals, for example a horse kicking him.  He also tells stories about the owners of the animals.  For anyone interested in becoming a vet, I'd highly recommend this, but it is also entertaining for the rest of us.  This is a period from the past before many drugs and modern treatments were discovered.  I understand more vets today practice on dogs, cats, and other companion animals as opposed to large farm animals.  Film and TV versions of the book are also available.DATA:Copyright: 1972.  Genre: memoirs, veterinary rural practice."
"A charming collection of stories from the life of a 1930's veterinarian in Yorkshire, England. Herriot is as good a writer as he is a vet. Although, I believe I now know far more than I ever wanted to about the uteruses (uteri?) of various farm animals, I do plan to read the entire series. Herriot's prose and genuineness really capture a reader and leave one wanting more."
"Yes, you, Mr./Ms. Reader, if you've never read this book before, you are in for a rare treat! Readingany of James Herriot's books is an exciting, laugh-out-loud funny treat!  In addition to thoseadjectives, you might want to add calming, relaxing, a visit to a better time and place in your life,many more descriptions.The first time I read it, years ago, I instantly fell in love with James Herriot, Mr. SiegfriedFarnon and a complete cast of characters, some human, but, mostly animals. He has a way with descriptions that is unique. One minute you're laughing your head off, the next thing you know, youfeeling so sorry for him that you can hardly stand it!  Makes you want to jump right into the pagesand give him a helping hand.  Not that he needs it; he handles every situation in his own way.I wouldn't deprive you, Mr./Ms. Reader, of discovering the pure pleasure which comes from reading this book, especially if you've never read it before.This is one book, along with Mr. Herriot's other books, that I highly recommend to readers of all ages.  As the saying goes, ""Try it, you'll like it!""  See for yourself. How I envy a first-time reader!"
"Great description.  Great ordering experience. Good delivery.  Would recommend to any Amazon buyer! Thanks, LDM"
Thanks Kristi for recommending this book.  Really enjoyed it....
Wonderful true stories about a blessed and appreciated life.
"All of James Herriot's books have been a delight to read.I seldom laugh out loud while reading, but this book contained those marvelous moments.The world and life described in this book are so refreshing.  Anyone would enjoy it."
Wonderful!!
"James Herriot, pen name of James Alfred Wight, wrote at least 15 books.  “All Creatures Great and Small” is his best-known book that was the model for the television series of the same name.  A film with the same title was also produced in 1975.  A sequel, “It Shouldn’t Happen to a Vet”, was produced a year later.This book is semi-autobiographical. We see events through the eyes of James, a young vet newly graduated from veterinarian school and seeking employment. He finds a job working for Siegfried Farnon and lives with him at Skeldale House. Tristan, Siegfried’s younger brother, who is good-hearted but lazy, is also a resident.James and Siegfried take care of the farm animals (and sometimes dogs) in the Darrowby area of Yorkshire.Herriot writes well.  He is a wonderful storyteller. The stories are engaging and often funny. Events take place in the 1930s before antibiotics and steroids. James and Siegfried use other remedies, some of which work and others that are mostly for show. For instance, Universal Cattle Medicine, a red liquid smelling of camphor and ammonia was used when the vet did not know what was wrong with a given animal. Seigfried had bought the veterinarian practice from an elderly man who had been a vet for 60 years. He left behind his veterinarian tools that included a fleam for bloodletting. Siegfried actually used the fleam to cure a cow from a bad laminitis infection (an inflammation of the hooves), and it seemed to work for him.The author was qualified as a veterinary surgeon at the Glasgow Veterinary College in Scotland in 1939. He was born in Sunderland, England, but grew up in Glasgow. He had a Scottish accent and had some difficulty communicating initially with the farmers in the Yorkshire hills, just as James did in the book. He worked as a veterinarian near the town of Thirsk in Yorkshire, England near the Yorkshire Dales and North York Moors.  In the book, the vet had a practice in Darrowby and in the surrounding Yorkshire Dales and moors.  The description of the town and countryside is similar to that of the area where the author had a veterinarian practice.In “All Creatures Great and Small”, Herriot shows a deep love of animals in his tales of a Yorkshire country veterinarian. Animals play a significant role in most of the stories. The farmers, in the countryside around the fictional town of Darrowby,come alive with their individual quirks and characters. James’ courtship of Helen, who later becomes his wife, is a delightful interlude from his stories of the farmers and farm animals. Each chapter could easily be a part of a serial in a monthly magazine. With few exceptions, each chapter can stand by itself as a separate adventure. The writing is fluid and beautifully descriptive. I could easily imagine myself in the scenes and events in each story."
One of my favorite books of all time. I've read all three & reread all Creatures Great and Small these many years later. I enjoyed it all over again!
"I kept reading people who'd review a book, by qualifying, ""He's no James Herriot!"" After the third or fourth time seeing it, I decided to read one of Mr Herriot's books! What a delightful journey I embarked on! I left 2015 and landed in pre-war England's Highlands, if I'm not mistaken. I loved this book, from the beginning middle and end! I found myself laughing out loud at his employers eccentricities, his disastrous dates, the animals and so forth, praying all the while no one at home would think I'd lost my mind! Although I was enjoying the read, I found I was trying to quickly finish so I could get to the next book! Whomever loves animals and a well told, excellent story, you won't be disappointed! Mr Herriot's is one gentleman who's writing will enchant and uplift you! I now too, am a James Herriot's fan!"
"Classic, must read. Great for all ages."
"I enjoyed this book very much. I'm looking forward to reading the others. There is humor in the stories he tells of his life, vet practice, courtship and marriage.  It's very interesting to get a glimpse of how life was then and how large animal vet practice was done."
Wonderful book. Well written and very interesting. Can't wait to read the rest of his books.
"James Herriot's first memoir, All Creatures Great and Small, provides the reader with wonderful true stories about the author's experiences as a veterinarian, fresh out of college, and his involvement with animals, their owners, and his colleagues, set in the picturesque Yorkshire hills of central England.This is a phenomenally interesting book, focusing not only on the creatures (all sizes, ages and conditions of dogs, cats, farm animals, and so on), but also the interesting characters, which owned these animals, and the amazing work that was done by vets in the days just prior to World War II in England.  All Creatures Great and Small is a warm, often hilarious narrative, written in the first-person by this wonderful author.  See for yourself why millions of people have purchased and loved this book as their own!"
"Excellent transaction!!!!!!!!The book was in very good condition and the cover also.This finishes my series!!  Thank you, MH McInnis"
"I felt compelled to submit this on the birthday of James Herriot.""All Creatures Great and Small"" is a heartwarming collection of tales told well of a veterinarian as his travels takes him over the lush wind-swept fells of Yorkshire.  Never have I longed to return to a place I have never been.  I feel his adoration of a timeless land, the endlessly toiling farmers, and the mischievous brothers he works alongside.This book is an excellent choice to present to someone if you wish them to enjoy reading.  The elation, the euphoria, and the occasional tale of woe is nothing but an affirmation the very essence of life.No spring is complete until I crack open its pages and revel in the gypsy pony, Helen Alderson, Tristan's pigs, and Clancy, the ""womiting"" dog.If I could only have a dozen books in my library, James Herriott's works would occupy most of it."
"All Creatures Great and Small opens an unforgettable series of personal memoirs by a country veterinarian in 1940's Yorkshire (also known as James Alfred Wight).  These are written in a series of short chapter vignettes, with a warm, wry humor that vividly, affectionately, and sometimes mercilessly captures human nature in the context of this cultural scene.  Many descriptions are laugh-out-loud hilarious, and will be spontaneously read aloud to the nearest listener.  But Herriot is no cynic -- his writing pokes fun at himself at least as often as others, and his self-deprecating wit provides an appeal that is near irresistible.  This first book in the series follows Herriot's starting-out years as a vet, his induction into Siegfried Farnon's local practice, his adjustment to the local ways and customs, and his courtship of the lovely Helen Alderson.A country vet's life involves a lot of bloody and sometimes gross work, which will appeal to some readers and may repel others.  There is an obvious appeal for animal lovers and potential medical students, as he treats both pets and farm animals, and Herriot sets a good moral example through his kindhearted willingness to undergo inconvenience and indignity for the sake of the animals under his care.  Implicit throughout his books is the belief that humans have a responsibility to provide good care to the animals who serve them.In his portrayal of his Yorkshire clients, he attempts to capture the flavor of their speech, and this does include some profanities.  The words ""bloody,"" ""hell,"" and ""bugger"" appear fairly frequently, but there are few American swear words.  Parents ought to use discretion, but I don't think this element should not be too harmful for mature readers.Because some of the humor is rather sophisticated and Herriot's prose is sometimes difficult, I recommend this for ages 16-18, but if enjoyed with a parent it is quite likely to appeal to younger readers, especially those who have enjoyed Herriot's stories for children James Herriot's Treasury for Children: Warm and Joyful Tales by the Author of All Creatures Great and Small."
"I purchased this book for my Book club read for the month of August.  It was excellent and everyone loved the book.  Even if you are not an animal lover, you will still enjoy this book."
"How do I describe this book? Amazing, beautifully done, remarkable, fantastic, will be treasured for years on end!  All Creatures Great and Small, set in the 1930's  gives you a view of the beautiful Yorkshire Dales, introduces hilarious and lovable characters (whether human or animal), and  gives you a taste not only amazing veterinary work, but of a  vet's personal life. Dive into the world of a young vet by the name of James Herriot (pen name) as he takes  you on exiting adventures through the Yorkshire Dales. Whether dealing with a difficult calving, a stubborn farmer, a spoiled Pekinese, or his own colleagues back at Skelldale, young James tells heartwarming stories for  that will be read over and over again! If you are looking for a series of novels that can make you laugh, teary-eyed, or just  smile to yourself, look no further than James Herriot's All Creatures Great and Small, a heart warming novel for young and old alike!"
Can't believe it took me so long to find these books.  Wonderful stories with humor for animal lovers.  Love them and now am collecting them all! A must read!
This was the only book missing from the series.  Happy to receive it in such great condition..........and amazingly fast.  BlessU.
"I read this book many years ago.  Recently, I had it sent to a grandson who loves animals."
"This book is about the life of an veterinarian (James Herriot) in the 1930's. This book starts out when the James gets out of veterinarian school and lands his first job. Each chapter in the book is a short story about one animal case that James was evolved in. The book goes into great detail about the surgeries and procedures involved in working with the animals. In reading the book one gets a good feel for the small town in England and the life that people lead in the town. One thing is that drinking and driving was not considered a problem in those time, because many times in the book they describe drinking at the bars all night and driving home without a second thought.Even though the book is a bunch of short stories it still have a slight common thread running through it and a nice ending. The book started off slow, but I got really attached. It was a nice relaxing read."
"ames Herriot is a vet in Yorkshire, England, during the 1940's. He is assigned to the practice of Siegfried Farnon, who (together with his mischievous brother Tristan) already have a successful business. James undergoes a variety of adventures during his work, which are just as often caused by the characters of the county (including the Farnon brothers) as the animals in his care.[...]"
"I read this series of books years ago as a teenager and enjoyed it immensely. It's a surprise I didn't go into veterinary medicine. I am now a people doctor and frequently wish I were a vet. The book is extremely charming, heart felt, humorous and realistic. Many times, I feel like I am there with James as he is treating an ailing animal or owner. I also purchased the audio CD, unabridged, and have a great time in the car listening to a very personalized voice narrating the book."
"How can anyone possibly not love the series of books about the English country vet ""James Herriot""?What wonderful stories! Not only well-written, but filled with humor, understanding, and at times total pathos. Books to laugh and cry with--what could be better?In the late '70s, I discovered them in a Heathrow bookstall--something to read on a long flight to West Africa. I was instantly enchanted! I've read them aloud to my children and find that, now as adults, they often re-read them. As do I."
"I've loved these books since I was a child; Herriot was the very first writer whose catalog I tracked down at the vast Grand Army Plaza Library, and I wouldn't stop 'til I'd read everything..."
"I really liked this memoir of being an English countryside vet in the late 1930s. The book, though it did follow a loose chronology, seemed more like a series of articles or anecdotes than a cohesive novel. Some chapters did flow together, but the vast majority did not. That's not to say that I didn't like the book, because I did, I loved it - it had many parts that were laugh-out-loud funny - the brother, Tristan, was an especially comical character. The memoir was educational too, but the veterinary technicalities were well explained. It actually had less to do with animals than I thought it would - there was a great deal about people - even a central romance!"
"I loved these stories when I read them many years ago, but reading time is harder to come by these days.  Christopher Timothy does as good a job reading as he did in the BBC series!  Great for long trips, while sewing, etc .. any fan would enjoy this, or anyone who loves animals, or anyone interested in human nature (Herriot is a great observer of people)."
"Having recently acquired a small farm, I thoroughly enjoyed reading Herriot's tales.  And I have actually gained a great knowledge of animal care through his stories.  A must read!"
I have read several of Mr. Herriot's veterinary adventures and have delighted in all of them. His writing takes me back to a better place on this earth when life made sense. I will always cherish his little experiences and I have a greater appreciation for the country vet's talents and humor. What a dedicated lot they are.
"I am thinking about buying this book, is it a good choice to buy it--or not?"
"""All Creatures Great and Small"" is the first of four books in this brilliantly written series.  The companion volumes are ""All Things Bright and Beautiful"", ""All Things Wise and Wonderful"", and ""The Lord God Made Them All"".  James Herriot (whose actual name was James Alfred Wight) began his veterinary practice in 1939 and continued serving his community for half a century.  Each story that he penned carries the reader deep into the Yorkshire countryside of England and into the lives of many colorful and entertaining characters, both people and animals.  You will be captured by the tales and find yourself laughing out loud at the antics of man and beast, relecting on the beauty of the close friendship of a pet, and weeping over losses that we all suffer when one of our animal friends pass.  These are books to read again and again because they show the depth of compassion that one man had for God's creatures through a life lived in simplicity, and yet his writings are a profound example to all who love and care for animals."
"It immediately grasped my attention!  Warm, humorous, filled with interesting characters!  I loved the animal stories and I am not an avid animal lover!"
What a wonderful glimpse into the life of a rural large animal vet.  The description of the countryside makes me want to visit!
Wounderful stories!
"This book is truly an inspirational book. It shows a young man who loves what he does and does what he loves. Every part of this book is a perfect depiction of life. There is no part of fiction and it is awesome. Although there are some weird parts where the older English is a little hard to understand, the writing was well done. There were some medical terms and stuff but it was pretty well explained. I was never bored with this book. Overall it was such an inspiring book and thoroughly enjoyed it."
I have not read this book since the 1980s.  I do hope before I pass on someday that I get to enjoy the whole series again.  Sometimes I give someone a book as a gift.  This has been one of the few that I pass along.
"The most wonderful, humorous and also sad days of a big animal veterinarian in Great Britain's Highlands.  Mucky and cold, little sleep because the veteranarian went whenever a farmer needed him, with his faithful dog, loving wife waiting for him at home, cranky partner waiting back in the nice warm office. James Herriot writes the most delightful book on loving animals and crotchety farmers and his ingenious ways of treating them before the days of drugs.I strongly and joyfully recommend this book to any animal lover."
Never get tired of the authors books. Wonderful.
This is a favorite from way back. I'm introducing my 10 year-old son to these wonderful stories now!
It would not do justice to James Herriot simply to say that his book is beautifully written. While he wrote  he delicately painted every story in  detail. At times you felt  the suffocating heat of a byre or breathed fresh smell of spring lingering in the air. At times  you lived through the sorrows of  farmers in need or burst into laughter with adventures of  James with his car-minus -brakes.  All stories  told with great humour. You  do not just  enjoy reading the book but learn great deal about country life of Yorkshire Dales in 1930s.
I purchased for my Great Niece and was told she loves it.
"I bought the book for my 11 yo cause it was recommended. i ended up reading and enjoying the book, but how someone can imagine it suitable for youngsers under 18 is beyond me."
"The classic story based on the real life experience of a veterinarian in Yorkshire, England. James Herriot comes to Darrowby during a time when jobs are scarce and he needs to stay. But he finds he loves the people and the animals.His associates are a lively bunch. His boss, Siegfried Farnon, is kindhearted, but has an annoying habit of contradicting himself (and then blaming it on James). Siegfried's brother, Tristan Farnon, is the younger almost-vet who is stuck with the worst jobs, loves the ladies and a drink or two. The farmers and neighbors are generally are hardworking lot. Their stories give the true color of the place and time. James also meets Helen Alderson, the beautiful and enchanting daughter of a farmer.The classic tale was also turned into a BBC series (7 seasons). I would highly recommend both!"
"I have always loved animals, so this series was a natural one for me to pick up. The book can be read as though it were full of short stories, but reads even better as a complete story. James Herriot shares his success, failure, and humor in this beautifully written book."
"Mr. James Herriot is an uncommon writer, possessed of extraordinary skill and a mastery of the English language. When speaking of works of fiction, he is my favorite writer. His ability to choose perfectly appropriate and descriptive words, phrases, and metaphors to verbally illustrate unique characteristics, landscapes, feelings, and situations still has me mesmerized.""All Creatures Great and Small"" is autobiographical in that Mr. Herriot is the central character of the book, though James Herriot is the pen name of the real author, Jim Wight. However, since the work is defined as a novel, then one may assume that Mr. Herriot took certain liberties in relating many of the tales he unfolds. Mr. Herriot is a veterinary surgeon, and much of his novel specifically involves dealing with particular cases of sick livestock and ailing house pets. One should not quickly conclude, however, that this story is merely about the ramblings of a country animal doctor who at times finds himself in interesting situations, as some reviewers would suggest.Instead, my feeling is that Mr. Herriot utilized his visits to multiple and varied farms and residences in the British countryside to highlight the individual conditions, attitudes, and distinctive persons he discovered at each location. The book becomes absolutely delightful and poignant, for instance, when Mr. Herriot kindly sits at an aging woman's bedside and tenderly comforts her with his voiced belief that her devoted, loving dogs and cats are indeed possessed of souls and that she need not fear that they will again be her companions in the afterlife.And I do not believe I have laughed out loud so frequently while reading one book. Some of my personal favorites are when his brakes go out on his car and he must navigate a steep and winding descent to the bottom of a low valley, where his next veterinary visit is scheduled, and when he finds himself on his first date with the woman he is destined to marry and the only respectable dress suit he owns is several years out of fashion and far too tight-fitting, which is partly why he becomes far too nervous and a bout of awkward conversation and actions follow. Additionally, much might be said here about the quirky relationship Mr. Herriot has with his unpredictable and explosive yet perfectly harmless and generous employer, a Mr. Siegfried Farnon, and Siegfried's younger brother, Tristan. Farnon's demanding attitude regarding his veterinary business affairs, especially in the face of Tristan's irresponsibility in mishandling assignments and responsibilities, is often the basis for much of the hilarity in the book.In speaking of his relationships with those to whom he is closest on a personal level and the frequently visited owners of his animal patients, Mr. Herriot has an especially profound gift when it comes to praising the best characteristics that are found in the human race. He speaks with eloquent fondness when describing the beautiful traits he sees in his lovely Helen, his soon-to-be wife. And when he stumbles upon a man or woman who he feels is in ownership of certain admirable exceptionality, such as industry or thrift or honesty or discipline or gentleness, his written accolades of such persons is heartwarming and deeply inspiring.Thus I would say that this book has everything. It touches upon the topics of death, faith, humor, love, devotion, stewardship, human strengths and frailties, prosperity and poverty, work and idleness, occupation, and the list goes on. Given that these interesting topics are handled so capably by Mr. Herriot's writing talent, I doubt that any sensitive reader would find this book to be anything but delightful and praiseworthy."
"One of the best books I've read in my life.  A must read.  Very well written.  Makes you want to write like him.I remember seeing my high school biology teacher reading this book at her desk while she had some time to herself, while we did our thing with dissections, etc.  It seemed that she couldn't get her hands off this book.  And I'd wonder what the book was about.  Something about creatures.  Maybe it was about GOD and church and religion.Now that I've had a chance to read this book, twenty years later, I can say that it is a wonderful book!  You don't want this book to end.  And now I understand why my biology teacher was so hooked on it.This is a nonfictional book about an English veterinarian writing about his funny and sometimes dramatic profession.  From how he started, to his everyday events in a small town (away from the big city such as London) to how he meets his future wife, and his gradual establishment of his veterinary life.  This book is filled with funny moments that makes you pause with a smile on your face.  And has its poignant moments that makes you realize its wonderful writing.This book gives you a glimpse of what the veterinary world is like on his side, on the countryside of life, with real people and real stories, and of course, with real animals.  Animals and people and veterinary work that you will come to love."
"I can't add much more than the previous reviews.  How many books on Amazon have a 5 star rating with 100+ reviews?  Missed this one during school and read all three of Herriot's books in my 40's.  Truly lovely, wise, and transporting.  I will make sure my children don't wait as long as I did to discover these classics."
"This compilation of many of the stories of this master storyteller is superb in every way.  I've met the man and one of the subjects of his experiences (in the story of the man with cattle).  James Alf Wight (real name of author)was famous in the vicinity of Thirsk for his stories. One of his customers told me that as a kid he couldn't wait for the annual visits as ""Herriot regailed him and his family with stories the whole time.""  The book is a retelling of some of his stories - and entertaining in every way.  Super book!"
Wonderful and inspiring stories of a country vet are humorously written but also deliver a good amount of practical veterinary insight. It's nice to read from the point of view of a kind-hearted yet practical country animal lover.
"I bought this edition as a gift for a graduating vet student (every vet needs a copy in his or her office). The book is a classic, and the hardcover is suitable for gifting."
"I read his books as a teen and loved them. Bought the whole set for my grandsons, [teens]. They laughed until they cried. [so did I]."
"As a child, I grew up in a family that devoured the stories of James Herriot. You will laugh, cry, smile at the stories that are shared with the readers. At times I feel like I am right there by his side as he operates on an animal.At the present, I am re-reading the whole series. PBS movies are good-but not as good as the books.This books deals with the beginnings of his vet practice, and I get a kick out of James being an ""uncle"" to a dog and a pig."
"Read the first page. That's all you need to decide you want this book. The author is a veterinarian in Yorkshire, and perhaps my American readers are aware of a PBS series by the same name. He's just an amazingly gifted storyteller. This guy is a veterinarian, but his writing puts most ""professional authors"" to shame."
"Yes, this is my all-time favorite book, and it begins my all-time favorite series. Can you summarize the almost limitless appeal of Herriot? I will try. First of all, this book takes place in England, and I am a committed Angliophile. It is warm and compassionate without being soppy. It is a timeless memoir that cuts a slice out of the pie of time and keeps it forever. Prior to Herriot, I exclusively read fiction. Not just any fiction, but Science Fiction and Fantasy Fiction, both of which are as different from this book as jam is from vegemite (eeuurggh!). Reading Herriot made me realize that the old saying ""Truth is stranger than fiction"" left out something. Truth is BETTER than fiction. Enjoy wiht my compliments."
"James Harriott's ability t create characters, that we all recognize, rivals shakespeare's famous gift,.  His description is such that I went to England just to see that part of the world.  It is exactly as he describes it.  A very good read and one that makes us anxious for the follow on books."
"What can one say about a masterpiece.  For this is truly what this novel is.  This is a timeless classic that will endure for generation after generation.Follow the true adventures of Yorkshire veterinarian James Herriott and his charming comrades as he traverses the Yorkshire dales in the 1930's attending to the ailing animals that he loved so dearly.  You'll feel every mile as he bumps along over the fells and moors.  You'll see all the wild beauty of the extraordinary Yorkshire territory of England.  But most importantly, you'll feel all the emotions tugging at your heart from the hardened Yorkshire farmers to the humorous and warmhearted denizens of Darrowby.  You'll meet the inimitable Seigfried Farnon, James's veterinary partner, whose constant contradictions nevertheless fail to conceal a heart truly without malice of any kind and filled with love and generosity.  You'll meet Seigfried's brother, Tristan, with his, shall we say, overly relaxed view of life.  There's also Helen, the woman who captures James's heart and the hysterically funny Granville Bennett whose eating and drinking prowess is not to be outdone by anyone.  Yes, there are these lively characters and more that pepper the pages of this work of literary genius.But most of all, this novel will leave you with the warmest and coziest of feelings.  From the blazing fires in the drawing rooms to the shivering winter nights spent delivering precious new animal lives, you'll be drawn into this world of delight and joy.  Don't miss the opportunity of a lifetime to own this enchanting marvel!Smash B"
"I have read this book too many times to count, and it always makes me smile.  The characters are rich and warm, people I would love to meet."
"I love these type of memoirs. A person who is not boasting about their skill or having an attitude. Simply shares the love of his work and love of his county. All of James Herriot's books are wonderfull. I was introduced to the children's books a few years ago and just recently started reading his memoirs. Love it, some parts were a bit dry but the books still flowed well and drew you back. Love the depth of scenery and anicdotes about the area. Recommend any book of his."
"This was a great book. I decided to read it because I like animals, and I'm so glad I did. I loved this book; it was really funny and exciting. I am definitaly going to read more of his books and watch the tv show if it's ever on anymore. I think triston is hilarious. I would reccomend reading this; it was great."
I'm mostly a fantasy scifi guy but I'm also an animal lover and I picked up this book on a whim. I wound up reading all the books in the series and ended up loving them all and wishing there were more. This guy can really write and tell a story. What a gifted man. Great Vet and Writer. I must read for all. You will laugh out loud and at times shed a tear. This is great stuff. You cant go wrong.
"I have enjoyed reading this work over the years as well as the other books in the servies.  This story, autobiographical, of a English Vet just before the war, and later, after the war, is truely one of the top gems to be published over the past fifty years as far as reading pleasure goes.  The author is a natural story teller and truely a very, very good writer, actually, quite polished.  I certainly won't go into the plot or the story here as many others have already done so, but will, as I have, remark of the skill of this writer and the enjoyment his stories bring.  I admit to being one of those who have collected his work and tend to reread each book in the series ever so often.  Highly recommend this work.  I am sure you will enjoy it."
"Although I read this book years ago when it first came out, I still remember it. I loved everything about it and read all the books in the series. All of them were wonderful stories about animals.I highly recommend this book to all animal lovers! It is a classic that is worth reading more than once."
"The whole series of books by James Herriot are such fun to read.  You learn about animals, since he tells stories of cases in his every-day life.  I totally loved all his books when I was a kid.  I'm buying them now for my grandchildren."
"One is touched by the benevolence suffused in this book as the author relates a series of anecdotes of his beginning practice as a veterinarian in the Yorkshires towards the end of the 1930s. Whether relating about animals or people, even unpleasant or downright nasty ones, the humor employed renders the detailing to a benevolent undertaking. Most entertaining is the fraternal friction between Siegfried and Tristan and is one that will leave you laughing, hysterically at times. I read this book decades ago and recently reread it and it still retains its charm. No doubt that Herriot’s book led to an increase in vet students."
"If you are from an agricultural background with experience with animals, you will have a better understanding of the veterinary practice and procedures used to assist animals in their daily lives. It also relates various situations with normal occurrences of human life, both good and bad. Interesting book."
This is one of my all-time favorite books.  I have the series and they are all so much fun - you really feel like you are in this place and time.  Excellent - a true classic.
"Well written and surprisingly interesting, not just because the world of veterinary medicine is opened, but also because the world of the small Welsh town is also illuminated. I found this book interesting and engaging. Had I read it when I was young, I probably would have become a veterinarian. Highly recommend, especially for ""tweens""."
"My favorite author of all time. James Herriot is brilliantly able to capture the townspeople quirky, quaint personalities including their love of all animals great and small. This is the only book I have read over and over."
Always enjoyable. James Herriott is a pleasure to read. The chapters are short and his descriptions are entertaining. Old school for sure.
This book was a delight to read. Such a breath of fresh air! The author's grasp of human nature was spot on and unexpected in a book I thought was just about animals.
"Replacing my old paperbacks with hard cover.  None of the new generation of hardcovers are made well, which is a crime, but should hold up better than the paperback (which is probably over 30 years old--got it as a teen)"
"I am not a big reader, but I am a animal lover. This is my all time favorite book, I cant stop from re-reading the whole series over and over again. A lovely book to settle in with before bed, or on a rainy day."
"All Creatures Great and Small was a wonderful book, definitely one of my favorites.  It was about animals, which was what drew me to the book to begin with.  The book draws you in, not really in a suspenseful way, but in a way that makes you just want to keep reading.  Also, James Herriot tells wonderful stories and is willing to make fun of himself and situations he was in, some of which were his fault.  It was fun getting to experience his first few years as a country vet along with him.  You also get to witness his relationships with animals and the people around him.  Plus, all the characters are realistic and you believe all the situations that they are in. Even though there were a lot of good things about this book, there were also a few things that I did not like.  The author was Scottish and he lived in Yorkshire so some of the language was kind of confusing and often you had to guess at what the words meant.  In the beginning it was a little confusing, because usually each chapter talks about a different event in the authors life, but as you read you get used to that.  Also, some parts of the book could get kind of long and repetitive, but most parts kept your attention quite well.  Overall, I though it was a very, very good book that I would definitely recommend."
"All Creatures Great and Small by James Herriot and the other books in the series have been favorites of mine since I was a teenager. I love the individual stories about the animals, the laconic farmers, the flighty Siegfried and the irascible Tristan. I feel as though Trickie Woo is a part of my family, and the story about the thermometer disappearing into the cow is one of the funniest stories I've ever read.These stories are delightful to read when you need a pick-me-up. Sometimes funny, sometimes sad, but always amusing, Herriot's love of the animals he serves comes through loud and clear. The only problem is that once I start reading them, I am unable to put them down!"
"I read James Herriot when I want to escape into his world,a world in which there are friendly farmers, amusing characters and a world with no malice even though a few humourous bungles occur.For a while I am infused with Herriot's love for this world, more forgiving of faults in folk, a very pleasant place to be in. I almost wish I could share in Herriot's rounds, treating animals, joining farmers in their kitchen for a friendly chat and a cup of tea. All his books are a real treat!"
"As an animal lover this was the most touching book on animals I have read since ""Born Free."" It evoked fond childhood memories of the fine TV series. The authors lively, heartwarming storytelling of his life as a Yorkshire Veterinarian was a cheerful read. His stories of animal and human interaction are something that I am sure most readers could relate to. They portray a man whose compassion and humor can actually inspire hope, even in our pessimistic age."
"James Herriot doesn't just write in this novel.  He picks the reader up and takes him or her along with him to his first traveling veterinary job.  The stories run the gamut from sad to amusing with an emphasis on the latter and the writing is superb.  I'm reading some other books by ""authors"" who don't have side jobs and they can't rival the mastery of writing that James Herriot exhibits in his very first novel.This is an excellent book as are others in Herriot's collections.  You can't go wrong.  If you haven't read anything by Herriot, you're missing out.  Start with this book and you'll want to keep a part of you in Herriot's world from now on."
"I can't imagine a reader finishing this delightful tome without wishing he had become a veterinarian.  The message from page to page is the writer's love for his profession.  Herriot is such a sweet spirit in his relationship with family, friends, clients, partners and patients.  Do yourself a favor and purchase this book; it'll give you several hours of smiles and chuckles."
"This book is the template for great writing about animals. I have never found anyone who can top Herriott for combining humor, pathos, character study and warmth in the ""animal"" genre. . This is a book that will delight people of all ages forever. I'm sure Herriott has been the inspiration for many a veterinarian career. Every one of his books maintains the same consistently top-notch writing. A great holiday, birthday, anniversary, or any other occasion gift. I think I'll go back and read this book again right now!!"
"I bought this book on CD to listen to on a long journey because I have read James Herriot and knew what I was getting with this book.  This recording is superb.  Christopher Timothy, who played James Herriot in the British television series, narrates and does a great job.  Some people simply read the book for these recordings; Timothy, however, adds personality and depth to each character and really brings the stories to life.  My whole family enjoyed listening and we have recommended it to several friends."
"The main character of the book is a precocious young veterinary surgeon that loves animals. James has extraordinary equanimity, but every now and then, it wears thin and snaps. James' employer, Siegfried Farnon is a very indecisive man that has a younger brother, Tristan. Tristan is often subject to Siegfried's wrath because de simply cannot do anything right. One may offer the opinion that it is unjust that Siegfried construes any of Tristan's actions as a crime, but Tristan is the car's worst night-mere and makes mangles wrecks of any automobile he comes across. Although much rancor is exchanged between the Farnon brothers, they manage to iron out their wrinkles after a while. Siegfried, however is a world of his own. This is because his great moral rectitude is patience. Siegfried constantly takes of a saintly expression and is completely prepared to forgive James for something he did himself. The irony this book contains will supply endless enjoyment. Every now and then, James meets a contemptuous client such as Mr. Sidlow. The Sidlows hold an exceptional disdain for veterinary surgeons in general. This is because they have a habit of perpetually using medieval remedies on their livestock like shoving raw onions up the rectum before calling a vet out to see the moribund animal once there is no hope of alleviation. One thing this book talks about is the bars that James and Tristan go to for relief. These are not the cacophonous bars you see today. Generally, the bars are small establishments that farmers make for a little extra income.If there's one thing veterinary surgery isn't, it's monotonous. Never will you find an onerous chapter in this volume. Even though this book is retroactive, contemporary young men and women will find it packed with loving fun and hilarity. I venture to say that the story telling ability of the author transcends many a skilled writer. This is a good book for any precocious youth."
Came just as expected and quite rapidly delivered!

"James Herriot's books are, for me, the ultimate in comfort books. Which is odd, it occurred to me while listening to this audiobook; there's blood and gore and uterine explorations and knackerings and death and cruelty… There is casual mention of deeds and practices which would turn PETA's collective hair white. But I've been reading these books since I was about ten. (Which, considering the language, is surprising. Them Yorkshire farmers were salty, mind.) And then there was the wonderful tv series.That last is what made the audiobook ideal: the reader is Christopher Timothy, who played James in the series (alongside my beloved Peter Davison as Tristan). I think he's one of those I'll follow anywhere, listen to anything he reads. He's perfect. Not just because I know him so well in the role already – he is a warm, funny, compassionate reader, wonderful at the accents and natural in his delivery.Just like Alf Wight, better known as James Herriot. The things I mentioned before – well, they were simply a part of life on a Yorkshire farm, in a Yorkshire veterinary practice in the first half of the 20th century. It was as it was, there were no better treatments than some of the medieval remedies used, and for the most part animals were well kept because they were vital to the livelihood of their owners. There is a surprising lack of sentiment overall, whether the animal in question is a pig or a puppy, a horse or a heifer.Which isn't to say the stories are strictly cool and clinical – not by a long mark. Tricki Woo is the perfect embodiment of the series as a whole. The pampered Pekingese ""son"" of a rich widow, he is a good-natured little furball whose ailments tend to stem mainly from that pampering. And when he goes flop-bott or shows other symptoms which alarm his Mrs. Pumphrey, ""Uncle Herriot"" is summoned on to the scene at once. The reward for James's promptitude is baskets from London at Christmas (I can't even fathom how expensive that would be, sent all the way to the Yorkshire Dales in the 1930's) along with other periodic delicacies – so James, naturally, has a mercenary fondness for the Peke. But he is also genuinely fond of the dog for his own self, as a personality, and of Mrs. Pumphrey as well. And balancing it all out like a splash of lemon juice is Mrs. Pumphrey's chauffeur, responsible for the spasmodic bouts of exercise she penitently orders, along with the role of body servant to the dog, and he loathes Tricki with a deep and burning passion. (And when the pig Nugent comes along, there is much hilarity.)So, yes, there is some cringing as we visit the knacker's yard, or when some archaic remedy is brought out. But it merely acts in the same lemon juice fashion on the warmth found in the daily interactions with the farmers and peers and kids with their goldfish, the dogs and cats and horses and pigs and cows and sheep, the slowly disappearing way of life of the Dales farmers. The madness that is the Farnon brothers; the surely-hopeless love James has for a client's daughter – eccentric as it all can be, it still rings true, and that's the key. The book is, to co-opt what they might say about a particularly nice cob, as sound as a bell.So, whether it should be a comfort book or not, it got me through a particularly bad night recently. The very definition of a comfort book. I love these stories."
This book appeals to animal lovers everywhere. Even to some who aren't so interested in animals because of the comedic way of his outstanding writings.
"I read this book shortly after it came out in the 1970s, and I thought my son (12) would enjoy it as well. I was so happy to find this edition with the original cover design to give him. He got through it in a flash and is on the third or fourth book in the original series."
"Excellent book!  Would recommend to any reader.  Very funny sections, describing issues he faced on a daily basis.  Tristan was a hoot!"
This is a autobiography that is written like a novel. The chapters are episodic and well written with good pacing. I read it once before when I was young and loved it. I recently bought it again and it is still a great read.
"Great book for any child or adult interested in Veterinary medicine. Great descriptions of  the animals, the old English countryside and life as an old school Vet."
"This is a book that persons of any age should enjoy if they have any love of animals. The author is exceptional in his descriptions of a Vet's procedures, touched with humor and his love for the animal."
The original Dr Pol. Great reading that allows me to escape my present position and relax. I'm glad I found it
"This book is a timeless treasure; a masterpiece of folksy writing that just draws you in and makes you feel truly comfortable. You can just see yourself watching in the background and Herriot tackles everything from delivering young lambs to minor surgery on horses. A reader feels connected in a way that is remarkable.I have no idea how many times I've read this book in the last 10 years, but I've no doubt that I'll continue to read it on occasion for as long as I draw breath.Just a marvelous adventure."
"There's an irony in the fact that this book I always found so calming and happy, that made everything on earth seem perfectly all right to me whenever I read it during bad times or good, is actually set during an era when trouble was brewing in Europe and the Third Reich was on the rise, destined to end this wondrous little world forever. That fact aside, I love this book. It is plainly magical. The stories here about James Herriot and his life as a rural veterinarian in 1930's Yorkshire radiate joy. Herriot knows how to tell a heartwarming, funny tale, but he never lets us forget that a country animal doctor's life is hard, sometimes tinged with sadness, and that even in a lovely place like the farming midlands tragedy is never far away. He practices veterinary medicine in a small town and out on the little family farms that dot the dales. His boss Seigfried (later his partner) and Seigfried's jovial brother Tristan work beside James as they answer midnight calls to birth calves, stitch up injured sows, and partner with the local farmers to keep England's agricultural concerns feeding the nation. Around these duties, James has assorted adventures and is a time or two lead astray by the charming, well-meaning but definitely problem-prone Tristan, who with his skirt chasing and love of the odd pint is perpetually in danger of flunking out of vet school. These lovable men allow us to come along as they mingle with some of the most amazing characters ever seen in fiction. They work with farmers who live in such isolation they have in some cases never been five miles from their own homes, and Herriot's prose celebrates their glorious idiosyncrasies. The vets are also cared for by the stern no-nonsense Mrs. Hall, whose stoical outer features hide a heart of gold within her gray-haired workaholic frame. This novel, set over about two years at the very end of the 1930's always brightens my day. It makes me wish things were still like that somewhere in this world today. (And that I could go there.)"
"Wonderful stories about farm life in rural Engkand as Herriott lived it, as a young veterinarian. His stories are amusing and "" feel-good"" all at the same time.  Great stories for all animal lovers."
"James Herriot's books are just plain wonderful.  I own them all and have read them again and again.  I must say, though, this is my favorite.  I've seen a bit of the BBC series and it doesn't do the books justice.  Herriot draws you into his world and makes it come alive in a way that is truly remarkable.  I have ZERO experience with this time period or with veterinary medicine, yet, I find Herriot's descriptions of and insights into his world uplifting and fascinating.  Buy the whole set, and don't miss his adaptations for children.  (The heavy drinking and womanizing of some of the characters make the originals inappropriate for very young readers.)"
"I first became acquainted with the ""All Creatures"" series written by James Herriot as a high school student writing a theme paper for my British literature class. After reading the first installment I quickly read through the rest of the series "" All Things Bright and Beautiful, All Things Wise and Wonderful, The Lord God Made Them All"". The plot centers around James Herriot, a newly qualified veternarian and his employment as assistant veternarian to Siegfried Farnon in the village of Darrowby. You will also meet a cast of colorful characters, Tristian Farnon, Siegfried's younger brother, Helen Alderson, Mrs. Hall, Mrs. Pumphrey and her Pekinese, Tricky-Woo,and a host of other colorful characters who make this a memorable read. James Herriot has also authored several other books, each one stands on its own merit and are a treasure for your family library. The BBC also produced the series "" All Creatures Great and Small"" for television in the late 1970's. The series is a masterpiece! I would highly recommend watching the episodes as you read through the books. The books/series are fantastic family entertainment!"
"The life of a country Veterinarian may sound quite unexciting, and rather boring. However, it is anything but, and that is proven by the tales that James Herriot (aka James Wight) tells about his time working in a small Yorkshire Village as just that. Straight out of University, James is given a position as assistant to resident Veterinarian Siegfried Farnon - a quirky fellow with very short-term memory. Through tales of strange animals and even stranger people he has met up with, Dr. Herriot weaves together a marvelous story that will make you laugh, cry, and so much more. A lovely book for animal lovers.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"
"All Creatures Great and Small is a heartfelt story about James Herriot, a local English veterinarian, and his adventures of being a vet. Herriot begins his novel by talking about himself and what he does as a vet, ""If you decide to become a veterinary surgeon you will never grow rich but you will have a life of endless interest and variety."" He says. He uses flashbacks from college to relate to his work, ""The old chap certainly wasn't kidding. Variety. That it was- variety."" Herriot says, referring to his college professor.  Herriot also describes his ""love of life"" in the nonfiction novel.  James Herriot shares stories about his friends' pet pig or a dog he is caring for, during the period of time he needs for surgeries. He also comes across small problems, such as, cows with milk fever and a horse having difficulty getting up off the ground. When I first began reading All Creatures Great and Small, I didn't know if I would finish the novel because of the amount of pages and chapters, but as I reached Chapter five, I was hooked because of his enchanting and joyful tone. Don't let the number of pages fool you; if you love animals or are interested in becoming a veterinarian, this is such a great and loving novel to read."
"Well, books of short stories just don't get much better than this, do they?For me, Herriot is the only author in the world who can pull off heartwarming without being cloying. His amazing feel for the lives and dialogue of the Scottish farmers who he services gives each and every story a score of interesting details and conversation that is captivating for its novelty and authenticity.In this first book of the series, Herriot has more to say than at any other point in his career. Not that his brand of storytelling ever gets old, but here there is the added excitement of reading his first stories, for the first time.Another major draw for these stories is the look inside the nuts and bolts of veterinary practice, at a time when science was still struggling to overtake centuries of medieval techniques. Reading about sutures and powders and presentations is more fascinating than I ever would have thought possible.The character of Herriot himself is unflaggingly goodhearted, and yet utterly realistic; we see in him the best part of ourselves, and this too makes the stories a joy to read.I highly recommend reading this series chronologically, so that you can join Herriot as he moves from young apprentice to old master.I wish there were a hundred books in this series, but at the same time I'm thrilled that there's even one book out there that acts as such a standard-bearer for excellence in storytelling."
"If you ever wanted to be a vet... ""All Creatures Great and Small"" will either inspire, or send you running off to be a lawyer. Heartwarming, funny, sad and highly educational, James Herriot's debut biography (he wrote five in all) give readers the whole messy, glorious picture of being a 1940s country veterinarian.The book opens (after a brief chapter taking place several months later) with James arriving in Yorkshire, to be the assistant to the eccentric but kindly Siegfried Farnon (yes, that is his name). He becomes accustomed to Siegfried, Siegfried's mischievous younger brother Tristan (yes, that is his name), and the gruff, kindly farmers who eke out a living in the Yorkshire Dales.Among the oddballs James encounters: Pampered pooches, savage pigs who chase Tristan around the farm, a nightmarishly strict secretary who drives Siegfried up the wall, James's brakeless car, cows running on three cylinders, a sadistic vet who makes James wear a rubber bodysuit, and an elderly, immensely wealthy widow who adopts a pig. And through this, James falls in love with the beautiful Helen Alderson and worms his way into the trust of the farmers.James Herriot (real name, James Wight) was truly a one-of-a-kind man. He let readers into his head throughout the book, where the cows kick him across the yard, farmers often treat him as an interloper or a nuisance, and his boss gives contradicting orders from one day to the next. But he never loses his drive or his love of animals. Okay, he hates some animals, but only as individuals.He even lets the readers see him at his worst, when he's humiliated by some recalcitrant livestock, and one horrible scene where he and his date show up drunk and mud-smeared in front of the girl he adores. (Not to mention when Tristan got him to use very feminine-smelling bath salts) But don't think that all of these stories are funny or romantic -- quite a few are aggravating or outright sad. James didn't soften the blows at all.There are a lot of details about surgery and animal care that will nauseate the squeamish, but at least you'll learn a lot of medical trivia. For example, what is a torsion? Herriot tells you early on, when he documents his nerve-wracking first case. But more than that, his love of animals is infectious -- it's easy to come out of this with a new appreciation for ordinary dogs, cows, cats, and so on.The people around James are just as fantastic: Siegfried, his weird but genial boss who can kick Tristan out of the house and forget about it overnight; Tristan, the mischievous anti-scholar who usually manages to keep out of trouble; and Helen, who seems a little too saintly at times (which isn't surprising, since James married her).It's sweet, sad, funny, romantic, dramatic, and full of the blood and sweat of vet work. ""All Creatures Great And Small"" is a truly unique and heartwarming biography."
"James Herriot is a wonderfully gifted writer. The way he can describe a scene with the exact perfect wording and phrase is simply uncanny.You are THERE on the Yorkshire dales living the lowly daily life of a young vet.Add to that Christopher Timothy's truly masterful performance and this audio book should be in the hall of fame. I cannot recommend it highly enough.A breath of fresh air. Genuinely hilarious, heart warming, uplifting.Give yourself the best gift ever. Listen to this book."
"This is where it all started with James Herriott for me - a paperback tucked in with 3 or 4 other books I received for my birthday a long time ago.  I couldn't tell you what the other books were, but this book, and its sequels, have become dear friends.  I can tell you the stories from memory (and from my heart) and I have read the paperbacks so often I've had to replace them with hardbacks just so they'll last longer.James Herriott was a vet practicing in Yorkshire (England) from the end of the Depression until about 20 years ago.The stories are charming, happy, glorious, tragic and tear-jerking.  It was a wonderful but brutal time to be practicing veterinary medicine.  It was before many of the surgeries we have now and Herriott was there for the introduction of antibiotics and many other medicines.  Think about it - how often have you had your cat or dog treated for infections - 60 years ago there was nothing to kill the bacteria that brought death to so many.  How impossibly hard it must have been for him to lose so many of the animals he treated, and how wonderful when he knew he saved them either for the farmers who needed their stock or the families who loved their pets.  And the people he writes about!  What characters!I have pets and love to read the stories about cats and dogs and horses.  I teach medical students and use more than a few examples from these books about the PROCESS of thinking which is so essential to any practice of medicine.  His stories here and in later books about diagnosing hoof and mouth disease or husk or heatstroke or nettlerash are fascinating reading about the mind of a physician as it works while the seconds of life tick away.This book is great, the series of books is great - curl up somewhere and get to know them."
You have to be dead not to enjoy this book. I just wanted to register my five stars.
"I consider the characters in James Herriot's book to be among my best friends.  They have always had the ability to make me laugh or cry as I read about their exploits.  James Herriot wrote about his life in a way that should be a model for all of us as we live our lives.  His stories show a deep respect for all living things and a love for nature.  He was a keen observer of human relationships and an admirer of the essential traits that make us all tick.  Besides being all of these things, he was a masterful writer.  Each of his anecdotes ends with a satisfying clincher and his descriptions are rich enough that you can smell the Yorkshire pudding and feel the blistering wind.  He created in me such of love of that environment, that I went to ""Darrowby"" on my honemoon just to retrace his steps.  Do yourself a favor and read this book!"
This country vet will win your heart and make appreciate  what veternarians go through. All of his books are heartwarming and humorous and sensitive. I came I read I laughed I loved them all.
"You don't have to be an animal lover to enjoy this collection of heart-warming true stories told by a country vet. Some of the stories are funny, others are sad; none will leave you unmoved. I highly recommend this book."
"Such a great book and a great beginning to an amazing series.  I never had the oppourtunity to read this in school, but my older brother had a copy of it laying around for many years, and one day I picked it up and started reading.  The stories were so engrossing it was hard to put this book down.  The narration is so rich and textured, you can almost feel yourself transported to the places and meeting the people and animals, having the experiences the author talks about.  In a way, I am sort of glad I didn't read this when I was younger, as I doubt that I would have appreciated as much as I do.  Even though the stories take place a world away, the author has a way of making it seem familiar.  After I finished this book, I went on to read the rest in the series, and I was never disappointed, but this one will always be my favorite.  A great book for anyone, even if you don't care for animals."
"Wonderful book by James Herriot, a country veterinarian in Yorkshire, England. It was the first of a very enjoyable book series, and was made into a TV series.It tells of James' beginnings as a veterinarian, and how he learns to adapt to the people, countryside and the animals. It's a well-written tale that's sure to touch your heart, make you laugh, and perhaps shed a tear or two. Never enough good things to say about this book--it's a great one!"
"""All Creatures Great and Small"" is a passionate and autobiographical account by James Herriot of his early years as a vet. Recently qualified, the young Scottish James finds work in the 1930s in a remote area of the Yorkshire Dales, during a time when jobs, let alone paying jobs, are scarce. In possession of only a small suitcase, he makes his way to the middle of nowhere in Northern England, waits around for an interview with his new boss, which he lands despite having fallen asleep in the garden when his boss finally returns.The eccentric Siegfried Farnon hires young James, and together they run a practice that mainly deals with cattle and farmers. Of course, being a stranger in this community is not easy, nor is it easy being a vet. Farmers have their own conclusions about cow diseases and some bizarre (non-scientific) treatments for them. It is up to James to convince them of his new found skills and to prove his worth in what is a reticent but deep down, a kind-hearted and generous community. In his job James runs across a bunch of interesting characters: his boss, Tristan who is the boss' carefree and accident-prone younger brother, farmers, a rich lady with a fat dog to whom James becomes and adopted ""uncle"", as well as a girl or two.The story is warm, funny and heartwarming. The story is not only an interesting personal story, but also fascinating from a historical and scientific point of view. And let's not forget James' relationship with all the animals. Herriot demonstrates a rare talent for telling an engrossing story.Thoroughly enjoyable, and highly recommended to audiences of all ages.."
"I loved the book so much! It was so sweet and funny! It is one if my faviorts! So touching, I love animals and so to here the many stoies of this vet was my kind of book. It was like you were walking with him thuogh all these little things that he dose. ALl the little cute animals that he takes care, The hiloures owners that he meets and his silly parners that he works with makes it a book you cant put down! James Herrot is so lovable himself. you cant help but  to love him! So, for anyone who loves animals and cute light hearted  stories will love tyhis wounderful book!"
"James Herriot's All Creatures Great and Small is the greatest book about being a veterinary assistant.  Herriot begins his story when he is fresh out of vetranary school.  Anyone who loves animals and is thinking of maybe becoming a vet would love this book,too.  There may be a lot of pages to read, but this book keeps you guessing what will happen to him next.  I would love to recommend this book even to people who love adventure stories.  In this book you may be able to relate to a lot of problems that Herriot has.  Some of his problems are easy and some are hard.  For example sometimes he comes in late about midnight then gets a call to deliver a calf at 2 a.m. in subzero temperatures.  I hope you take my advice and read this wonderful book."
"All Creatures Great and Small is a book about James Herriot's spirit after becoming a veterinarian in 1937.  His life-long journey begins when he moves to the beautiful countryside of Yorkshire England to work for Dr. Farnon.  Dr Farnon is a respected veterinarian in the area and becomes James' mentor.  James learns very quickly that there are many ups and downs in his vocation.  Angry farmers, stubborn animals, and 3:30 house calls are just the start of his fun.  His compassion is very evident in this book.  He is a great role model for anyone.  I was interested in reading this book because I am pursuing a goal to be a veterinarian myself.  This book gives me very useful insight on how I could live my own life.  I would recommend All Creatures Great and Small to anyone interested in reading a heartwarming story about animals."
"I first read this book when I was in elementary school, and that launched me into the wonderful world of James Herriot.The reason I love this (and the other books in the series) is because the author creates a wonderful picture of the beauty of life in the Yorkshire Dales.  I love his writing style!  Every character in his book is interesting or amusing, including his own character.  Even the animals have very interesting personalities.Unless you are terribly squeamish (because there is some vivid detail about veterinary procedures), I highly recommend that you read this book.  I think it would be a very enjoyable read for almost anyone."
"James Herriot's books stand out in modern writing as absolute classics, evocative of an earlier, more innocent time, and more wonderously, by the skill with which these deceptively simple, entertaining, moving stories are written. Beneath the entertaining text and characters lies absolutely beautiful, artful writing, with craft and skill that ties all these chapters and stories together in a pattern of one country vet's life in England in the 1930's and 40's. These are so much more than animal stories. I am biased; these are my favorite all-time books, read and re-read since my youth. Increasing age has not diminished their charm. History will write James Herriot's name large. If you haven't read these books yet, you owe it to yourself to start with ""All Creatures Great and Small"". Whether or not you care for animals, you will fall in love with a gentler time, the escapades of a trio of young men, and the laugh-out-loud as well as very tearful events this author writes about so beautifully. Absolutely timeless and a classic."
"This is NOT a great work of literature. It is as wonderful a work of master story telling as is available anywhere. James Harriot is able to place his world of animals, their owners and his life work with them on the pages of this book. A truly good read, indeed."
"This is most definatly, the best book I've ever read! James Herriot tells all these stories with so much detail, you often feel like you're almost there.  The best thing in my mind about this book, was that even though all of his stories happened such a long time ago, he still remembered them in such detail, that it was like all those events in his life happened just yesterday."
This is book was absolutely amazing! His stories and characters made me feel like I was right there. Being a gonna-be Veterinarian this is the best book for inspiration. It showed me the pros and cons of being a Vet while creating a warm story that I will always remember!
"These stories are true treasures. While the BBC series is amusing, these stories are far more personal. You get to met Dr. Herriot (a pseudonym for James Alfred Wight) who starts as a young veternarian just out of school and joins a country practice. Cows get the better of him, the local Yorkshire farmers one-up him, he gets his car inevitably stuck in the mud and yet prevails as a caring, resourceful vet who loves his quirkly rural clients as much the animals he cares for. He also writes with such laugh-outloud humor and self-deprecation you just wish the book would go on and on. Fortunately, he wrote four more of these books (each named for a line in a hymn) and a memoir of his father, in whose practice he began. They really give you the flavor of rural life in England before and after WWII.I can't believe these stories are 30 years old, and Dr. Herriot has passed on. Thankfully he left this legacy behind for us to savor. These are books to re-read on dreary days with a cup of tea or just when you really need something to lift your spirits."
"This book is quite possibly the best book I have ever read! This book started out great and ended just as well as it started. Even though I am only 14 years of age, I still thoroughly enjoyed this book to it's full potential. All in all this book got the highest mark on my chart. If you like animal stories or just like a really good book you should read this one!"
"All Creatures Great and Small is a book for anyone who loves animals. Or country living. Or medicine. Or good writing. This is a feel-good book. Herriot relates his experiences and emotions as a new country veterinarian in pre-WWII England. Some events are funny, some sad. The book as a whole is moving, uplifting. This first book in his highly successful series is a literary walk down a country lane in Springtime. A great choice for FFA kids, pet nuts, or crabby old people who could benefit from a big whiff of fresh air. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."
"James Harriot is perhaps one of my favorite authors.  His easy style, good-humor, modesty, and charm permeate his writing...and his subject matter - life as a country vet in Yorkshire in the mid-1900's, is enchanting."
"You can never go wrong with one of Herriot's books,  they are all good!  Read them all,  you won't be disappointed especially if you're an animal lover or a fan of history."
I find it very entertaining. I was reading it to my 11yo when my 18yo came over and joined us. when my 11yo went to bed my 18yo asked me to read another chapter.
"I re-read this after some time reading move heavy novels and really real that I needed something more uplifting. I am quite the animal, remembered loving the book years ago, and had been in the mood to read it after watching the BBC program. It worked wonders. I had a hard time putting it down and while yes there were times when the writing was slightly haphazard it was always done I'm a warm reminiscing quality that just made you feel good about everything."
It was a Christmas gift for my Dad who is in a nursing home.  I understand he is really enjoying it!
"I read all the James Herriot books back in the 70's when they first came out and were best sellers. I don't know why I waited so long to read them again and make them a part of my library. After I finished All Creatures Great and Small I bought all the rest of his books. I love his books and will read them again and again. They are utterly charming, funny, and pleasant to read. If you've never read them, please do yourself a favor and get started. If you read them like I did back in the 70's reread them! The whole family would enjoy these books!"
"James Harriot, country vet and really nice person, had a flair for writing, AND a life worth writing about.  Trials and joys of a Yorkshire country vet in the early-mid 1900s, told with love, humor and sensitivity.  James Harriot was one of the best story tellers of our time, IMHO, and well worth the read."
"My favorite books have always been about animals.  MY FRIEND FLICKA, THUNDERHEAD and LASSIE COME HOME.  WAR HORSE is one of my favorite movies."
This was the first of James Herriot's books about his veterinary life.  It is one I hated to see end.
"This is my 2nd time reading this book, the first being 25 years ago and it's given me even more pleasure that when I first read about the lives of this vet and the wonderful Yorkshire characters, both animal and human!  I loved the TV Series and recommend you see that if you can. His language is not flowery or exaggerated but simple and yet profoundly descriptive. He describes scenes that most of us will never come close to experiencing but he draws the reader so intimately into his world that one feels you're right there with him as he battles the elements, an aggressive animal or a cantankerous human! It's heartwarming, funny and a darn good read!"
Wonderful read. I had donated book & was happy to purchase for my Kindle. As I've downsized book wise this is a real treat to have again.
"I've read ""If Only They Could Talk"" & ""It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet"" more than 20 years ago. The 2 books are part of ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL.  Back than,  I'd laughed and cried while reading the stories - my favorite character was Herriot's boss, Siegried and Tristan (Siegried's younger brother) and of course all those village follks whom Herriot had encountered during his practice. I have introduced the books to my two teenage sons, and they too, have enjoyed reading them. I have to say ""If Only They could Talk"", ""It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet"", and ""Let Sleeping Vets Lie"" are my top 3 favorites."
"The key thing to understand is this book/audio is much darker than the TV series.  Herriot's clients are mostly animals in labour with various ghastly problems. Somehow hearing about them rather than seeing tame simulations, greatly amplifies the gross out factor.The farmers don't give the young vet any respect, and it really grates on him.  It is almost as though he wrote the book for revenge.Timothy Christopher the reader is amazing.  He creates a distinct voice for each character, including Mrs. Pumphrey, Tricki Poo's companion (reminiscent of the  Amy De La Pompa character on The Royal Canadian Air Farce).  He does all kinds of Yorkshire accents that sound right on -- at least to my ear weaned on British TV."
"Great price, easy ordering and receiving. My problem was though the description said 'good' some writing in the book, I wish it said it had a girls name in bold pink letters on the outside. This is a required school reading for my 16 yr. old SON."
"I want to warn all Herriot devotees that in buying the omnibus editions they are NOT getting all the stories! For example in Jim's courtship of Helen, the episode of the Daffodil Ball is omitted. Let me demonstrate. 'In Let Sleeping Vets Lie' chapter twenty three begins:  ""After the night of the Daffodil Ball I just seemed to drift naturally into the habit of dropping in to see Helen on an occasional evening."" However in the omnibus edition we have:  ""After the night at the cinema with Helen I just seemed to drift naturally  into the habit of dropping in to see Helen on an occasional evening""How dare they do this? I am extremely annoyed to have spent my money on these omnibus editions. I will now have to go to all lengths to get the original books which Amazon will not ship to New Zealand.The American publishers think they know better than James Herriot how his stories should unfold. They are wrong."
"This beloved book is brought to life by the narrator, Christopher Timothy. I have it on my iPod and am enjoying it immensely!"
"""All Creatures Great and Small"",is a unique book to be sure.James Herriot's series is like a breath of fresh air.I do remember reading this series eons ago.I just loved the story of how a new veternarian triesto make a go of it in the harsh climate of the Yorkshire Dales.Just recently, I was given these precious books that werea part of my deceased fathers library.What a wonderful surprise to see that insidewere notes that my father had written while reading these books.It was like having my father back for a moment or too.The stories of Herriot's  new life as a vet, are full of adventures and and mishaps along the way.Plus, the added addition of the farmers who came to admire the determination of this man to make a differencein the care of all animals, great and small.One can't help but laugh and cry, while reading these books.Siegfried,the owner, and his brother Tristan, are a delightful addition.Their banter will have you in stitches.Oh, and we certainly can't leave out Mrs. Pumphrey and her dog Tricki Woo.Who could forget the famous words spoken over and over.""Oh, Mr. Herriot,I am so glad you've come.Tricki has gone flop-bott again"".A genuine classic to be sure."
"My son was not a reader, but this book peaked his interest many years ago, and he loved it.  I was telling his 11-year-old son the story, and he wanted to read it.  I hope he will enjoy it just as much as his Dad."
Such a great read. My husband is in his first year of veterinary school and it was fun to see how far the medicine has come. I definitely recommend for anyone who is married to a vet! I will definitely be reading his other books in the near future.
I already have a beautiful set in hardback but wanted  some on my iPad with the kindle app. I am so disappointed that you haven't made them available with the kindle device.  Please change thus soon.K.  Hirschfeld
"This is one Audiobook you can never get tired of listning to, it is fun and interesting.  This is actually my second set of CDs as the others just needed to be replaced due to extreme use.  The service I recieves from Amazon was great, as was the shipment, it arrived as expected on time and in perfect condition!  Thanks Amazon!"
"If you want to become a vet, read this book. It shows the effort that a country vet had to make before the computer age. Very touching."
This book makes me want to be a vet in Yorkshire
"I enjoyed being a part of the life of Dr. James Herriot, a kind and respected veterinarian of the early years in England.  The book was enlightening and entertaining as the author incorporates events in his own  life, events in the lives of his patients and their owners, with a  humorous, informative style.  I highly recommend this biography to  everyone!!"
"I first read All Creatures Great and Small when I was ten years old. I was in a foster home, and it was the only book that I owned, other than War & Peace, by Leo Tolstoy. I tried reading War & Peace, but I was a  little young to understand it. I read James Herriot's wonderful  autobiography, and I was uplifted from my isolated life as a foster child.  Now I'm 18, and I am reading it again, all the while feeling the same  escape that I did when I was ten."
All Creatures Great and Small was a wonderful book.  I learned a lot about James Herriot and his life.  This book showed me all the  strength it takes to be a veterinarian.  I really reccomend this book for people who want to  learn about a great man and an exciting job!
I only read this book because I had to. It was torture! I hated it. Too long and boring
I loved this book and I think that I will read it again!!!  :
I gave this book 5 stars. This is because as you read it you come to know the people of the Dales. Each one has a distinct personality. It most definately sets a higher standard for writers of the future.
Great book for all ages. Show the love between a vet and his patients. James hariot master at bring the human and animal race together.
"James Alfred Wight, under the pysdonim James Harriot, delivers a heartwarming tale of life in the english countryside as a veterinarian. I laughed unctollably, sighed, read and re-read this book, and still do on an  almost daily basis.God bless you Alf, whereever you are!!!"
"I picked this book up one day with no clue as to what it was. After having read it I've concluded that it's the best story that I've read concerning animals (excluding animal farm). It also helped me understand life as a  veternarian (at least some fifty years ago!) I've also come to the  conclusion that Herriot has created a brilliant novel in his first try that  have taken so many others years to complete. Synopsis: A heart-warming true  tale of a veternarian named Dr. James Herriot in the late 30s in Yorkshire,  England."
All Creatures Great and Small is a fascinating true story about a veterinarian named Dr. James Herriot who cures animal illnesses and wins over the hearts of animal lovers. He has unique courage and warmth that touches many people who have read this book. This was a very good story  that was so good it almost made me cry. I recommend this book to anyone who  loves a great animal story.
"All of James Herriot's books inspire everyone to give, and keep giving.  They give real examples of how life can and should be lived."
"It's been six years since I first bought one of James Herriot's novels, and far longer since I read his picture books (e.g. Bonnie's Big Day). Even now in my last year of high school, it's a choice I have never regretted  making. All Creatures Great and Small is just one of the most heart-warming  and touching books written by someone who was truly blessed by God. This  book is serves as an inspiration and companion for the soul of any  animal-lover, one whose stories will never fade with the passage of the  years. It brings every facet of life and love into being, and is a calling  for all animal-lovers around the globe. I have James Herriot, my idol, to  thank for helping me choose veterinary medecine as my future career, a  choice I have stood by for eleven years!"
"Most people will read this book and be engrossed by the wonderful characters and happenings in its pages.  However, it should not be overlooked that James Herriott is one of the best storytellers ever to take up a pen.If one looks closely at the progression of the narrative in  each story, the simple-yet-satisfying dialogue and the very rich prose that  is amazingly easy to digest it's clear that James Herriott has a  distinctive literary style that appeals to the senses and the mind as well  as the heart."
"One of my all-time favorite books!  I have re-read the entire series three times.  In fact, I lost my original copy of ""All Creatures Great and Small"" and had to come here to buy a fresh copy.  If you know an  animal lover, do them a favor and give this book as a gift."
"This was a revolutionary book. This is the book that Herriot uses to first introduce us to his friends, both human and animal alike. You will find yourself laughing through tears as we follow this Scottish vet to an  English land filled with inspiring stories of people, farmers, and of  course, animals. The quirky characters lend us a picturesque look into the  life of a country vet. There is just no other author who can touch me the  way Herriot does. This book is not just a woman's book (as my review seems  to point to), but men will find the farmers and Herriot (though sometimes  drunken) screamingly funny. Herriot's memoirs are indeed a classic in it's  own right. The only item that seems to frighten readers away is how truly  English the book is written. The strong Yorkshire dialect can make the new  Herriot reader a little frustrated at first. Yet stick with it. It will  certainly come to you sooner than you think. It's worth the trouble...  Believe me!"
"When I was in 7th grade I recieved All Creatures Great And Small as a Christmas present.  At first I did not know what to make of it, however I had always been an animal lover and decided to take it for a spin.  Never  before had I run through the entire spectrum of emotions while reading a  novel.  Sad and dissapointed when an animal is lost, tense when a life is  on the line, and relief when the patient has been brought back from an  untimely death.  There is no better description of Jim Herriot(White)than  that of an eloquent story-teller.  He does not try and elevate his  vocabulary so as to be difficult to understand, but states his experiences  as a country Veterinarian in ways which are somehow able to draw the reader  into the enchanting setting of early 20th century Yorkshire, England.  Now  a junior in High School, I have this book to thank for steering me in the  direction of Veterinary medicine as a future career.  Reading this novel  has changed my life, and may do the same for you."
"This book is the only book that has made me laugh, cry and everything in between.  James Herriot is an amazing storyteller and every one of his stories is beautiful.  The description in this book makes me want to move  to England, and the stories make me want to become a vet. I also loved the  other books in this series (All Things Bright and Beautiful, All Things  Wise and Wonderful, and The Lord God Made Them All). James Herriot's  stories will be immortal.  READ THIS BOOK!"
"All Creatures Great and Small transports you back to the pre-war English countryside, but it may not be as bucolic as you might think: the new vet must  stand up to the long-time farmers and win their confidence and win  battles against disease and injury with the local animal population.  At  the same time, he develops a rapport with the quirky brothers who hired him  into their practice, he begins building social relationships with the  villagers, and he begins to lose his heart to one of the area's farm girls.  All this -- with the specter of World War II advancing like approaching  storm clouds upon these warm, humane people.  The characters, setting, and  heroic battles to save the animals and a way of life are totally  unforgettable.  A book to treasure."
"I found this book to be a very easy read, and would recommend it to anybody that reads at the fourth grade level or higher.  The Scottish author, James Herriot, describes his life as a newly hired veterinarian, in  pre-WWII England.  He shares with readers his experiences in handling  distressed animals, their owners and caretakers, the business of being a  veterinarian, and the successes and failures of love and life.His  descriptions of the situations he was in, were right on.  Being British,  and the grandson of a blacksmith, I could easily picture in my mind what  kind of weather he was experiencing, or how dark a barn, byer, or piggery  might be.  His characterizations of the local farmers and townspeople were  great, and he met some really interesting people!The book left me with a  new respect for what life was like for people in the days when life seemed  so much simpler than what it is today.  I have just started ""All  Things Bright and Beautiful"", and look forward to completing it, and  the rest of Herriot's books in the future."
"This is the first of a series of sort-of-autobiographical books written by  ""James Herriot,"" a real-life country veterinarian in Yorkshire,  England.  The first book covers his arrival in ""Darrowby"" in  1937, when new research and new technology were just beginning to change  both farming and veterinary medicine.  We meet James' boss, Siegfried  Farnon, and Siegfried's fun but irresponsible brother Tristan, as well as a  wide variety of local farmers and pet owners.  As good as the BBC series  is, the books are so much more.  I think readers of any age (these books  are perfectly suitable for older grade school age children) who like  animals will enjoy the stories here, as will anyone with an interest in  English country life, or stories of days gone by."
"All Creatures Great and Small is a wonderful, witty, poignant collection  of stories about Veterinary life in the thirties.  The stories are full of  rich detail, wonderful humor, and great respect for the animals and the  people who care for them.  The book gives you an idea of what it was like  for people in that difficult time before WWII, when England was very  depressed, and medical care was just moving beyond the folklore age.  Yet,  the stoic people of the Yorkshire Dales keep their humor, and their stiff  upper lips in a trying time.  I would recommend this book for readers of  all ages, including intelligent  older children, as there are no really  objectional passages.  One of my favorite booksof all time, it made me want  to become a Veterinarian."
"If you ever plan on being a vet or maybe just a scientist, you have to  read this book. I like it a lot because James Herriot brings out the more  enjoyable side of veterinairy medicine. It's definetly a book that was too  hard to put down. It has a lot of stories about cows for all those Beef  lovers out there.  Jeremy T."
"James ""Jems"" Herriot provides the reader with a look into a bygone age in the North of England when the science of veterinary medicine was on the cusp of modernity. His recounts of not only his experience with animals, but with his employer, Siegfried, and his pursuit of female companionship are so sweet and funny that I often found myself smiling from sheer pleasure. I would have loved to have met this gentle-man and gotten an eyeful of his borrowed black patent leather dancing slippers  with their silk bows!Luckily, on cable TV, is Animal Planet where there is weekly series that provides a glimpse into present day vets in England, Vets in Practice, and complements Herriot's writings well and gives visualizations to many of the same situations in which Herriot found himself, e.g. difficult cow births. I admire the dedication of these country vets and feel priviledged to have been given such a wonderful look into this man's life. I cried when I finished it- I am such a sap, I know...I look forward to reading the other titles in this series."
"The book is very kind, very human, perceptive and responsive. It creates goodness in a man what I think is one of the great tasks of art. I thank for excellent Czech translation."
"Monique Gammon Sunnyvale C.A. 6/5/98  The book All Creatures Great and smallby James herriot was not my first pick.  Infact it was my last choice but because ai was absent on the day my class handed them out I was stuck with it.  My first impression was ""Great now I have to read this fat old thick book""  I wasn't to happy.  But, after reading the second chapter I started to enjoy it. By the middle of the book I couldn't put it down.  What I enjoyed most about it was the love story and the struggle Mr. Herriot had with his boss.  For a person that dosen't enjoy reading this probebley wouldn't be the best book for you.  It is a realy good book with ggreat stories.  One sujestion to you is to organize your time so you don't end up breadig the whole book in one week.  Because if you do that you won't get the full affect of the book.  PS.""Try not to judge a book by it's thickness""  The movie Titanic was a long movie but a great one at the sametime."
The book that my group read was called All Creatures Great and Small by this surgeon named James Herriot.  The book was not the best book in the world and it did get boring at a lot of times but I did manage to read all of it.  It was interesting to see a man work so hard to take care of all kinds of different animals.  The funny part was when he was looking for a lady for him.  If you do love animals and find living on a farm interesting then go ahead and read this book I am not going to stop you at all.  It wasn't my kind of book though.
"After having surgery, I was very sick and could not concentrate on anything but pain.  To distract myself, I picked up this book and read it.  It is such a comforting and wonderful book, it really took my mind off of my health and sped up recovery.  Everyone should read it."
"This has to be the best book I  have ever read,even better than ""Horse Whisperer."" Jim tells of his experiences about being a country veterinarian in Yorkshire,Darrowby,and other neighboring cities. He tells of different adventures he has at the Skeldale House,where he and his colleuge, Seigfried, work. Herriot tells of good times and bad,and of his encounters with people and animals alike.This book really increased my vocabulary, it helped me to become more literate about animals and diseases. Everyone will love this book. Five Stars *****"
"This is a beautifully written book! I read the whole series years ago and it was fun rereading this book. If you like animals, you will like this book!"
I love these books and have read the whole series many times.  They are lighthearted and funny and true which makes them even funnier - to the point where you laugh out loud.  I can't say enough good things about them.
Very well written. I felt like the three main characters were friends of mine. I would love to have James as my vet!
"The hardback book arrived in a timely manner and in perfect condition.  It is a good quality product.This novel, as all of James Herriot's literature, is just wonderful. I'd highly recommend it."
A doctor friend reccomded this for my 9 year old since she want to be a vet. She loved itWhy do we need to type so much in this field.
i Loved the way the story was written. It came to life for me.the animals were like people at times.
Terrific book if you love animals.  Including the strange animals called humans.  Sweet stories of a different time and a different world.
I have been a fan of Dr. James Herriot since his books first came out and wanted to revisit the country vet.  The book does not disappoint as he takes you through his experiences as a new vet in the Northern region of England from the late 1930's through WWII.  A TV show was made from these stories and are very true to the books.....I catch an episode ot two on Netflix streaming almost every day.  I find each one brings me a good laugh or two and I come away with a smile each time.
"This book is good. It is interesting enough for me to keep reading but certainly not an ""I can't put it down"" book.  Of course, these are the author's personal experiences, so judge for yourself."
"I'm stating my fourth in the series of books by ""James Herriot""  (a pen name). As much as these stories are about the interactions between humans and animals, they are also a study in being human. The author and the varied and diverse people he encounters are a lesson in humanity-""it takes all kinds."" From the wildly funny to touching pathos, Herriot's  stories take us back to a simpler time and place and are a great escape."
"James Herriot was a country veterinarion who lived in Yorkshire before (and after) World War II. His stories are funny, heartwarming, sad, and highly educational. And after reading this, you will either want to be a vet or be very grateful that you aren't one.The book opens (after a brief chapter taking place several months later) with James arriving in Yorkshire, to be the assistant to the eccentric but kindly Siegfried Farnon (yes, that is his name).  He becomes accustomed to Siegfried, Siegfried's mischievous younger brother Tristan (yes, that is his name), and the gruff, kindly farmers who eke out a living in the Yorkshire Dales. Pampered pooches who are spoiled rotten, savage pigs who chase Tristan around the farm, a nightmarishly strict secretary who drives Siegfried up the wall, James's car-with-no-brakes, cows running on three cylinders, a sadistic vet who makes James wear a rubber bodysuit, and an elderly, immensely wealthy widow who adopts a pig. And through this, James falls in love with the beautiful Helen Alderson and worms his way into the trust of the farmers.James Herriot (real name, James Wight) was truly a one-of-a-kind man. He let readers into his head throughout the book, where the cows kick him across the yard, farmers often treat him as an interloper or a nuisance, and his boss gives contradicting orders from one day to the next. But he never loses his drive or his love of animals. (Okay, he hates some animals, but only as individuals) He even lets the readers see him at his worst, when he's humiliated by some recalcitrant livestock, and one horrible scene where he and his date show up drunk and mud-smeared in front of the girl he adores. (Not to mention when Tristan got him to use very feminine-smelling bath salts) But don't think that all of these stories are funny or romantic -- quite a few are aggravating or outright sad. James didn't soften the blows at all.The people around James are just as fantastic: Siegfried, his weird but genial boss who can kick Tristan out of the house and forget about it overnight; Tristan, the mischievous anti-scholar who usually manages to keep out of trouble; and Helen, who seems a little too saintly at times (which isn't surprising, since James married her). There are a lot of details about surgery and stuff like that that will gross out the squeamish, but at least you'll learn a lot of medical trivia. (For example, what is a torsion?)It's sweet, sad, funny, romantic, dramatic. ""All Creatures Great And Small"" (and its four sequels) is a fantastic read for all ages."
"Given that the usual age-group of Herriot's readers are late teenagers, the book came a little late into my hands. Dr. James Herriot puts across his trials and tribulations as a novice vet, ""a Mr. Smartpants""  among hardy Yorkshire Dalesmen who are convinced of the superiority of their own home-grown remedies but nevertheless make calls at all odd hours whenever a horse is foaling or a cow is ""running on only three pistons"" (one of the four udders is calloused). Great descriptions of the picturesque countryside and an incisive observation of character (including his own) makes this an intersting read. Since at times there seems to be very little plot in the whole book, it is nicer if you read it just as a collection of anecdotes(some humourous, some tragic, some strangely both) about a young man about to start out in life. A lucid prose style and powerful narrative skils makes this a very satisfying read on the whole."
"I first read this book when I was fourteen. Got it at the library in Danville, Arkansas, as I recall during a summertime visit with aunts, uncles and cousins. Hated to put it down every morning and go to swimming lessons. Hated to put it down to eat. Hated having to turn out the lights and get some shut-eye. This book is about the joys and the struggles of everyday life, and of triumphs great and small. It's a book about animal husbandry and the way people connect with animals, even when they have trouble connecting to other people.I've read this book three or four times since that summer so very long ago. It is brilliantly written. What a great investment of your time if you choose to read this wonderful tale of life as a veterinarian in a faraway country."
"The only warning I give before you start to read this book is that you must be willing to donate many hours because this book will make you want to read every single one of James Herriots books. ""All Creatures Great and Small"" is a fabulous book. Currently I am going to school to become a veterinarian (including the cow degree) and after sifting through this book I knew that every person who wants to become a vet should read this book.Not only does it show the joys of bringing a struggling lamb in the world, or pulling a dying animal back from the brink of death, it also displays the downfalls of being a vet. The unexpected nightly calls, the confusing symptoms, and the claws and teeth that are attached to each patient are all also a part of being a vet.Through it all James Herriot shows a deep love of his profession which cannot help but bring a smile to the readers face.I recommend this book to any animal lover from cats to cows, James has to fight with them all in the England countryside."
"The book, All Creatures Great and Small is about Mr. James Herriot as a vet in his mid-thrities at a small town in Shorphire,Egland named Dowrby.  There he is the assistant of Mr. Seigfried Farnon.  They live at the Skedale House with Mrs. Hall and Tristan, who is seigfried's little lazy brother.  At Shropshire, Mr. Herriot deals with the problems of the farmers at the area with their livestock and other domestic animals.  Also at Dowrby, Mr. Herriot falls in love with Helen Aiderson.  Later they become married and live a wonderful life.The reason that I read this book was because our teacher gave us the assignment of doing a report on this book, and I thought that this would be a good non-fiction book to use on my book-reports.  I also choose this book because this is the biggest book in the class and I can read a lot.One of my favorite scenes in the book is the times when Siegfried goes berzerck and he sacks Tristan over and over again without ever remembering once what he had just done and still wakes up the next morning seeing Tristan eating breakfast with him and doesn't wonder why is my brother still here?  I think this is weird and I believe Siegfried has problems and should get professional hep because at some scenes in the book, he really freaks me out."
"To put it simply this is one of the best books ever. Fun to read yet, captivates you with it's amazing sence of humor,adventure, tradgity, and romance. Each chapter is a new story, each story completly differnt than the last but, with the same thrill for life. it has the fun charecters of Tristin, siefried, James herriot and everyone inbetween. From a bad tempered pig to a faitful sheep dog sam, the animals varie almost as much as the charecters. overall, most any book lover will adore this book."
"Written by James Alfred Wight under the pen name James Herriot, ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL is the semi-autobiographical adventures of a 1930s vetenarian working in Yorkshire, England--and as he grows in experience we meet the people and animals that populate his world.Any one old enough to turn a page will love this book.  It is written in an effortless and easy-to-read style, and the clinic's experiences with everything from runaway pigs to lavishly spoiled lapdogs makes for laugh-out-loud fun.  Who could forget Tristan's battle with a savage sow or the dog that howled?  How about the hens that flew the coop or Tricki-Woo's birthday party?  Or the car with no brakes or the cow that would never get up again?  Herriot's comic tales can easily make you laugh until you cry.But ALL CREATURES isn't only about laughter.  There is also the hard work of farming and the simple integrity of those who struggle to survive on the land, where the loss of a cow can mean the difference between surviving another year and financial disaster.  There is also the sorrow at the loss of a treasured companion.  And through it all, from the wildly comic to the poignant and touching, there is always, always the story of the relationship between man and animal, joyously told.  Easily one of the most completely enjoyable books I've ever read, and very strongly recommended."
"It is a great book!Each chapter is a new story of another faimly and another animal patient James Herriot is treating.  They are all  really touching, and most of them are funny and light hearted.  Herriot is a great story teller. He seems to make everything about life beautiful and new.It is easy reading and really enjoyible to read.  The chapters are short. So you don't have to read on forever to find a place to stop.Read it!"
"I got the set of all 4 of James Herriot's books in paperback when I was a teenager (a long time ago--okay!), and I have read them many times since. It is no exaggeration to say that in the darkest times of my life, these books have helped me to pull through. I could laugh and cry with the stories, lose myself and my problems for a while, and come out feeling somehow heartened and renewed. I always wished I had written Mr. Herriot to tell him this. Anyway, I recommend these books to everybody. They're fabulous stories that will crack you up and pull at your heartstrings. What more could anybody want? Herriot is a master storyteller, and the characters he creates are at once universal and unique. I defy anyone to read these and not be touched."
"When I was a child my mother read me James Herriot stories. As a vet student later in life, I read the whole series with a new perspective. All Creatures Great and Small literally opened the door to my future. While every vet has probably read it, this book is for anyone! Despite the easy read, James Herriot provides profound insight into humanuty and the importance of the simpler things in life."
"All Creatures Great and Small By James Harriot  Dr. James Harriot is a veterinarian living in the Yorkshire Dales, in England, the early 1900's.  In my book All Creatures Great and Small, James Harriot wrote about the unusual events that happen to him as a veterinarian assistant.  Other titles by James Harriot are Cat Stories, Dog Stories, All Things Wise and Wonderful, All Things Bright and Beautiful, and The Lord God Made Them All.  The purpose of his books is to prove that things aren't always what they seem. In the first chapter of the book, he is working at a ""calving"", when he finds that the calf is in the wrong way.  He tries to pull him around, but a man called Uncle disturbs him the whole time.  He finally pulls the calf out and goes home.  In the second chapter he's going to Darrowby to apply to become a veterinarian assistant when his employer, Mr. Farnon isn't there.  So he waits for the whole day until he finally comes in and shows him around the Dales. A very sad chapter is Chapter 6, when Dr. Harriot is called to a sick horse.  He rushes out there and discovers that the horse has a classical torsion and is dying.  When he tells the owner this he gets furious, but before the owner can do anything, Dr. Harriot rushes out to get an injection and finishes the job quick and easy. In conclusion, Dr. James Harriot is a wonderful writer. He has great talent.  I would recommend this book to anyone because of the daily chores he does and the activities that an animals' life could depend on."
I am a student of veterinary medicine in soouth asian cooountry called  nepal.NEVER HAD I READ A BOOK LIKE THAT.
"I am 16 years old and I thought this was an EXCELLENT book, but what  really annoys me is the previous person who wrote a review for this book,  they are either too young to have read it, or too cold and stupid to take  any of it to heart, BECAUSE IT IS A BRILLIANT BOOK !!!!"
"I really have nothing to add to all of the previous comments, except that  ""I agree...what a great book!!!""This book is also a perfect  volume for reading at bedtime or on the bus because it is broken into about  fifty short, stand-alone stories, so you can read just a little each night,  or put it down for six months and pick right back up where you  started.Some of the stories and insights just rip your heart out.  His  compassion for animals and people alike is inspiring and will bring a tear  to your eye.  What a great storyteller!"
"I am a 14 year old, and had to read this book for Honor's English over the  summer.  I got to pick the book, and I made the wrong choice.  It is long  and boring, and there is no excitement to make you want to keep reading.  The book consists of James, the narrarator and author going to farms and  treating animals.  There are many complicated medical terms and half the  time I didn't know what was going on with the aminal.  It has its good  parts, but they are few and far between.  I wold not have finished it if I  didn't have to."
"You have probably heard that Herriot is heart-warming, enjoyable, and all that.  (It's all true.)  But how so? And what is so instructive about it?Herriot was a small-town veterinarian who practiced for over half a  century in Yorkshire, Great Britain.  He took notes and remembered stories.  He did such a good job of it that he was able to put together half a dozen  books of his recollections.  The accumulated stories are a delightful  account of his efforts to get started in the practice, the whole gamut of  farmers and pet owners in his area, and all the little details you normally  wouldn't hear about.  What a man he must have been to have for a  grandfather.The great unheralded benefit of Herriot's writing, in my  view, is for the small businessperson who has a limited number of potential  clients and who must win them over to succeed.  By seeing how Herriot  handled a certain type of customer, one can improve the way one deals with  one's own customers.  The excellent results he ultimately got while dealing  with some very tough customers in difficult situations can show the way and  inspire you to greater patience and effort.  This, in my view, is the  hidden value of Herriot."
"This was the first book of James Herriott's that I read, and I just couldn't put it down. I was so caught up in the story, it transported me to Yorkshire in the'60's. He is a master story teller, the story becomes  alive, it makes you laugh and warms your heart. I could imagine all the  characters in the book, what they may have looked like, their mannerisms,  voice. I have read it over and over more than 10 times. It is both  humourous and heartwarming and one of the most interesting books I have  ever read."
"James is an absolute gifted story teller. I grew up with the BCC television series about this vet, and his books are the next best thing. Both children and adults alike will really enjoy these uplifting short  stories. I you like the Chicken soup for the soul series, you will not  regret buying this book, or any others James Herriot has written."
"I recieved this book as a gift then it was first published in the 1970's.  I have read it at least five times.  Each time I read it I am delighted all over again.This is an animal lover's delight - but it's much more than  that.  Follow the young James Herriott as he starts his adventure as a  country veterninarian.  You feel his pain and joy as he experiences  failures and successes.  His courtship with his wife-to-be Helen is  poignant.  Herriott tells it like it is: there's no fancy stuff.  Don't let  that make you think this is dull.  Herriott's descriptions of the landscape  and characters make you feel like you're there:  the sights and smells he  describes tantalize your senses.  You can smell the fresh country air, the  hearty farm meals, and so much more.This is a book that will delight  young and old alike.  Read a chapter and it's a mini-book in itself, or  curl up for the long haul.  I found it very hard to put down.You'll be  enchanted by Herriott's adventures (and misadventures) and find yourself  laughing and crying.  Even after 5 reads, I'm ready for another.  This  stuff never gets old."
"Rarely will you find a novel which so well captures the essence of real people.  This book goes beyond just talking about the life of a country veterinarian in Yorkshire and his cases with all forms of pets.  It brings  insight into the amazing relationships that people have with their pets,  whether they be dogs or cats, or farm animals.  We see the true grit of  birthing a cow as well as the tender affections that an elderly lady has  for her prissy poodle.  This book also includes biographical accounts of Mr  Herriot's clumsy courting of his future wife and other amusing side  adventures; marvelous truths that we see in ourselves.  Whether you read  this book for the vet's practice, the animals, the people, or all of the  above, you will enjoy what has become a treasure around the world."
I devoured the James Herriot bokks as a teen and am enjoying them again as an adult. What a bunch of quirky and extremely lovable characters! These books are quick reads but that most certainly does not mean they have no depth.  The dry wit and very droll humour never gets old.  Some of the events and the style of story telling could become repetitive and read as slapstick if written by a less accomplished author but James Herriot's voice is so very authentic and genuine.
"This book shows you the graphic side of being a vet in the early 1900's. As he develops and matures from an early apprentice to a well known vet, James Herriot has a very interesting story. When he cures a dying bull with cold water, he shows the communities what he is made of. James Herriot creates many new medicines as he sees these cases throughout his life.I think this book was amazing, eye-catching and made you keep reading throughout the whole book. I think this book is extremely good and everyone should read it. -- Reid"
"On the captivating cover, you see a humble man with an accepting look; but as they always say, ""Don't judge a book by its cover."" Most book reviews you will see will try to tell you a brief summary of the book and will afterwards fathom its greatness and superiority, but this review will be more helpful than any other you have seen.Let me just be frank with you. Don't Read this book!!!!!!!! This autobiography begins with James Herriot describing episodes in the normal life of a veterinarian. Let's accept life, people! It takes real talent to write about yourself and make it sound commendable. A trait this author did not show in this publication. The book continues with James Herriot finding a new job and having a pretty normal life in his small town in England.Although I hated every bit of this book, I really hated the part(s) whenever he talks in an annoying detail about asking for ""some hot water, soap, and a towel"" just before he untangles a baby inside an animal, for instance, and his descriptive ability of basically boasting his achievements of solving complications inside an animal. I was particularly disgusted during these events because of their constant appearance in the book and how it never added to the excitement of the chapter or his life in general.I guess the writer really wants the reader to know about his life. Though from a reader's perspective, nobody wants to hear about a normal life.Now I should bring up the reason why I read this book in the first place instead of returning it to its home after reading the first chapter. I am pretty much forced to read this as part of a passing grade in reading, so I really had no choice.Just remember folks, never let ""The Clasic Multimillion-Copy Bestseller"" fool you. Notice how Classic is spelled intentionally ""Clasic"".So as a fellow reader and someone who has the ability to stop the plague of unhappy reading, I should warn you of the constant use of typos, and never using a period after an abbreviation; stuff that would normally get a reader pretty annoyed. So remember all you people out there looking for a good book, DON'T CHOOSE THIS ONE!!!!!!!!In case you haven't found out all ready though, I would rate this book 0 stars (though if you were to come up and ask me I would say -10... stars) -- Avishek"
Perfect stories from the life of a young veterinary doctor. The best book about people and animals that I have read in the last five years.  Herriot continues his story of life as an English country vet in All Things Bright and Beautiful and All Things Wise and Wonderful. These real life stories were made into an excellent BBC series.
"The book All Creatures Great and Small is a great story by an interesting author, James Herriot. On Amazon, there are almost no legitimate arguments against this great story. The positive reviews love the story because it really gives the reader a sense of what James Herriot is thinking as he tells his own stories. This book is in fact a multi-million copy bestseller, being loved by almost any book critic that has reviewed this great story.As a 14 year old reading this book for school, it is very interesting to read about all of the experiences that James goes through when working as a veterinary surgeon in a small town in England in the early 1900's. He shares all his experiences working with the animals of the many farmers in their town. James is just starting out as an intern at the beginning of the book, and has to face all of the social aspects of farmers not expecting him, the new guy, but expecting his boss, Siegfried Farnon. Farnon is an extremely forgetful man. Often, anything that James messes up, he will forget by the next day. This can become problematic when he gives Herriot advice, but the next day forgets what that advice was and gives Herriot completely new, contradicting advice. The way that James Herriot really exposes  the reader to every aspect of working in his new job is what makes this book such a joy to read. One of my favorite stories is when Farnon's brother, Tristan,  destroys two of Farnon's cars within one day.One of the reasons that James Herriot wrote All Creatures Great and Small is to show the importance of perseverance. James has to perform many unpleasant tasks throughout the story, including getting up at very strange hours for an emergency case, or completing a daunting task that usually takes hours with little reward afterwards. All of this shows that he had to persevere in order to accomplish his dream, and illustrates the lesson: never give up. James Herriot accomplishes this goal amazingly. Every chapter shows his hardships, and that he never gives up throughout the entire story. Herriot could not have done a better job expressing this lesson, and I am glad that he makes this important lesson very clear to all of his readers.Overall, All Creatures Great and Small by James Herriot is an amazing book because of all the interesting stories that he tells, as well as the important life lessons mentioned through the stories."
"Whether in small bites or full course meals, this book is a sweet treasure of short episodes in the life of a country vet in England,  I highly recommend it!"
"This CD has been brilliantly recorded by Christopher Timothy who was James Herriot in the original PBS series, All Creatures Great and Small.  I am trying to listen only in half hour segments in order to stretch the listening as long as possible.  There are times I laugh out loud and times that I tear up.  We watched the original series on television and have the video collection as well.  I never, never tire of this series nor the wonderful characters and animals.  This reading is absolutley brilliant as I said above and Mr. Timothy transports the listener to the dales of Yorkshire.  I cannot think of enough superlatives to recommend this to lovers of All Creatures Great and Small."
"I first read this series back in the 70's and also my children (10 of them). We all agree that these books are one of the most delighful and enjoyable books we have ever read. (We are all readers, even as adults.) Am now ordering the series for some of the grandchildren starting with All Creatires Great amd Small.  Also going to invest in another series for myself."
"Living in Britain during the late seventies, I became addicted to the television show of the same name. Fortunately, I found that the show was very faithful to the books. When the show finally ended, I began reading Mr. Herriots entire collection of memoirs. All Creatures Great and Small is as satisfying in print as it was on television. Mr. Herriot's description of the farmers and town folk he encountered during his tenure as a country vet confirms that the every day stories of real people can be just as interesting and entertaining as fictional characters, when told by an expert story-teller. The Cloudbase Chronicles - Life at the Top: Living and Working at Chicago's John Hancock Center - An Engineer's Tale."
"Living in England during the seventies, I became addicted to the television show which was based on Herriot's books. When the show ended I found myself craving more. The books are even more satisfying."
"I am in the middle of ""All Creatures Great and Small"" so far it has been a great book. I read ""Every Living Thing"" earlier this school year and I thought it was so great I decided to start another one of his books.  From reading this book I now understand some of ""Every Living Thing""In all of his books Jim tells of his experiences of treating animals. I am glad Herriot gives context clues for some of his diseases or I would have no idea what it was.This is a great book and all will agree if they read it."
"Speaking from my own viewpoint, that of a small horse farm owner and generally soft-hearted animal admirer, I would like to recommend this book to others who feel that ""something special"" for the four-footed kind.  The humor in this book also offers warm chuckles on cold foal-watch nights.  Anyone with a sense of humor, even should they hate fur or feathers, would truly enjoy this one.  Mr. Herriot's portrayal of his fellow man is not only insightful, it's downright uplifting!  (It lifted me up out of my chair and onto the floor a few times.  Laughing."
