This script uses logistic regression to predict how long an prospective employee will be with a company.
Data for all applicants can be found in data_exercise_applicants.csv.
Data for all hires can be found in data_exercise_hires.csv.
Rather than predict the total tenure length, we are interested in identifying employees who will be with the company less than six months, 
between six and twelve months, and for more than twelve months.
The features we explore (found in data_exercise_applicants.csv) are:
1.) answers to a quiz the applicant fills out at the time of their application
2.) which company the person is applying to
3.) how long they took to complete the quiz
