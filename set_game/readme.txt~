1.) To run this code from the command line:
    > python run.py n_cards file_name
where n_cards is the number of cards per hand, and file_name is an input csv file that defines the deck.
1a.) Input files are assumed to have one row per card, and one column per dimension the card can have.
1b.) I used integers to represent the values that each dimension could have.  This makes things simpler to 
parse, but could be generalized if string inputs are desired.
1c.) If no file name is given, the code will randomly generate a deck of 36 cards (4 dimensions with 3
values each).
1d.) If n_cards is not specified, the code will use the same randomly generated deck and pick hands of 3 cards.
1e.) Some basic input files I made by hand are included in the inputs/ directory.

2.) run.py executes the code

3.) classes.py defines the Card() and Hand() classes.
3a.) The Hand() class has a function is_winner() which determines whether the hand satisfies the rules of Set.
3b.) Both classes have debug modes to dump their contents for easier debugging.

4.) Additional, basic tests of is_winner() can be done using methods defined in tests.py, but otherwise, this
script is not needed.
